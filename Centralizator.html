Data was collected via a purpose-built application, which served two purposes: administer the survey and download consenting user's public wall posts, gender and age from the Facebook profile. The survey included questions on engagement in harmful online behaviors and the Short Dark Triad scale; 15,281 wall posts from 1972 users were included in the dataset. These posts were subjected to morphological, lexical and semantic analyses. More than 25\% of the sample reported engaging in harmful online behaviors. Males were more likely to send insulting or threatening messages and post aggressive comments; no gender differences were found for disseminating other people's private information. Psychopathy and male gender were the unique predictors of engagement in harmful online behaviors. A number of significant correlations were found between the dark traits and numeric, lexical, morphological and semantic characteristics of the participants' posts.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyber aggression,Dark Triad,Distributional semantics,Facebook,Russian language,Word clustering</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Science Direct <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:03 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.032</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_012</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">craker_march16</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Craker, Naomi; March, Evita</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2016</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Dark Side of Facebook\textregistered : The Dark Tetrad, Negative Social Potency, and Trolling Behaviours</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality and Individual Differences</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Trolling behaviours on social networking sites (SNSs) are problematic for other computer mediated communication users, as the psychological effects of experiencing trolling online are considered similar to the psychological effects of offline harassment. The current study explored personality traits and social motivations associated with individuals who engage in online trolling, specifically on the SNS Facebook\textregistered. The Dark Tetrad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and social reward (specifically, negative social potency) were examined for their predictive utility of trolling behaviours on Facebook\textregistered. A sample of 396 adults (75.9\% women, 24.1\% men) aged between 18 and 77years of age (M=34.41, SD=1.70) completed the Global Assessment of Facebook\textregistered{} Trolling (GAFT), The Dirty Dozen, The Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, and The Social Rewards Questionnaire. Results showed that trait psychopathy and sadism predict Facebook\textregistered{} trolling behaviours; however, negative social potency had the strongest predictive utility. These results show that individual trolling behaviour may be better explained by negative social reward motivation than negative personality traits. In addition, these findings offer practical implications for SNS administrators and everyday users of SNSs. Future research should continue to explore predictors of this understudied antisocial online behaviour.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Machiavellianism,Narcissism,Negative social potency,Psychopathy,Sadism,Trolling</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Science Direct <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:03 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.043</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">goodboy_martin15</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Goodboy, Alan K.; Martin, Matthew M.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2015</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Personality Profile of a Cyberbully: Examining the Dark Triad</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Computers in Human Behavior</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The present study examined the relationships between the Dark Triad personality traits and self-reported cyberbullying behaviors.

Online trolling behavior is more common in those who more frequently post text information on Facebook than those who do not; 203 (71.2\%) and 211 (74.0\%) experienced at least 1 instance of online trolling behavior or being an online trolling victim, respectively, in the previous week; 2. University students' online trolling behavior types are ranked by quantity as evocative trolling, malicious trolling, obstruction trolling, and pathological trolling; 3. University students' online trolling victimization types are ranked by quantity as identity victimization, dissemination victimization, malicious victimization, and obstruction victimization; 4. Sense of inferiority is a significant predictive variable for online trolling behavior and online trolling victimization. At the same time, social extraversion and depression significantly and positively predict online trolling behavior.

However, many of the published studies have yielded mixed findings related to cyberbullying and its relation to demographic variables such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Review papers have been published on some of these topics, but comprehensive reviews of the relation between age and cyberbullying victimization and perpetration are lacking, particularly with regard to protective factors. Thus, the current paper takes a developmental approach to examine age and cyberbullying. The review focuses specifically on age variations in technology use, prevalence of cyberbullying involvement, risk and protective factors, and outcomes.

At the same time, observers have noted an increase of individuals behaving in an unrestrained manner on the Internet, while researchers have reported elevated rates of cyber aggressive behavior. What remains unclear, however, is whether, and how, disinhibition might be related to cyber aggression. In an aim to explore the possible associations, a large sample (total N\,=\,709) of high school (Mage\,=\,15.56 years) respondents from New Zealand were recruited, and completed a survey featuring scales assessing personality and technology behaviors, attitudes, habits, and trends. The present study was designed to investigate whether the three dark personality traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism would predict false self perceptions, and in sequence, online disinhibition and aggressive online behavior. All three dark personality traits, as well as false self, were positively associated with online disinhibition. Perceptions of false self were found to be a significant predictor of cyber aggression when mediated by online disinhibition. In the case of cyber aggression, however, psychopathy, sadistic traits, and online disinhibition were found to be significant predictors of this outcome. The results collectively provide a more nuanced understanding of how antisocial personality traits are associated with maladaptive identity formation (i.e., endorsement of false self beliefs) as well as maladaptive online behavior.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303"></span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Science Direct <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:03 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.027</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_031</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">lyons_etal19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Lyons, Minna; Gillies, Naomi; Brewer, Gayle</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Dark Triad Traits, Facebook Intensity, and Intrasexual Competition</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality and Individual Differences</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Intrasexual competition supports the acquisition of new mates and the maintenance of existing relationships.

Much of the research has been conducted on social networking sites, where social motives play a fundamentally important role. I will also review research on linguistic differences associated with social media page contents, as well as the ability to identify personality from looking at individual social media pages. The key message in this chapter is that narcissism stands as the most relevant trait when it comes to self-presentation and seeking for online admiration, and psychopathy and sadism are important in understanding why individuals engage in aversive online behaviors such as bullying, trolling, and stalking.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Bullying,Cyber-aggression,Mating behaviors,Self-presentation,Social networking sites,Stalking,Trolling</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Science Direct <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:03 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/B978-0-12-814291-2.00007-3</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_034</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march22</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">INCOLLECTION</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">March, Evita</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">20 - Psychopathy: Cybercrime and Cyber Abuse</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303"></span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Despite the number of benefits associated with use of the Internet, a number of antisocial behaviors have emerged online.

The role of psychopathy in cyberbullying, trolling, cyberstalking, online child pornography, and cyber fraud is discussed. In addition, psychopathy is also related to broader antisocial online behaviors, such as cyber aggression and social media addiction.

An online survey was completed by 1009 Australians aged 18 to 79~years (M~=~32.4~years, SD~=~13.48) assessing D4 traits, dating methods, perpetration or victimisation of anti-social dating behaviours, and experience of coercive controlling behaviours. Analyses found a higher likelihood of experiencing anti-social dating behaviours for those using online dating methods (OR~=~2.01) and those higher in sadism (OR~=~1.83). Key predictors of perpetration include primarily using face-to-face dating methods (OR~=~3.17) and higher grandiose narcissism (OR~=~1.80). Finally, there was a higher likelihood of experiencing coercive control behaviours in both the online (OR~=~2.26) and face-to-face (OR~=~2.76) groups, and in those higher in psychopathy (OR~=~1.47). Mobile dating apps may provide a protective factor against both experience and perpetration of anti-social dating behaviours and coercive controlling behaviours. The D4 also continues to show strong links with perpetration of anti-social and controlling behaviours; however, sadism appears to be a risk factor for victimisation.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Anti-social behaviour,Dark Tetrad,Dating violence,Online dating,Relationships</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Science Direct <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:03 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2020.110099</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_068</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ang_etal17</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Ang, R.P.; Li, X.; Seah, S.L.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2017</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Role of Normative Beliefs About Aggression in the Relationship Between Empathy and Cyberbullying</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The present study examined the relationship between empathy (affective and cognitive) and cyberbullying in a sample of 396 (male = 173, female = 219, and four did not report information on gender) school-going adolescents from Singapore (age ranging from 12 to 18 years). Both types of empathy were negatively associated with cyberbullying as expected, with affective empathy having a stronger association with cyberbullying. We also investigated the mediating and moderating role of normative beliefs about aggression in two pathways\textemdash the relationship between affective empathy and cyberbullying and the relationship between cognitive empathy and cyberbullying. Findings suggested that normative beliefs about aggression was a partial mediator and moderator in the affective empathy-beliefs-cyberbullying pathway but normative beliefs about aggression was neither a mediator nor moderator in the cognitive empathy-beliefs-cyberbullying pathway. Normative beliefs about aggression served as the mechanism partially accounting for the relationship between affective empathy and cyberbullying. Furthermore, the relation between affective empathy and cyberbullying was found to be stronger for those with higher levels of normative beliefs of aggression. Collectively, together with other studies, this research contributes to an increasing number of studies demonstrating a stronger association between low empathy (in particular, low affective empathy) and bullying, whether traditional bullying or cyberbullying in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2016, \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2016.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1177/0022022116678928</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ang_etal17</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_071</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">azami_taremian21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Azami, M.S.; Taremian, F.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Risk Factors Associated with Cyberbullying, Cybervictimization, and Cyberbullying-Victimization in Iran's High School Students</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Iranian Journal of Psychiatry</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Objective: This study aimed at finding the risk and protective factors of cyberbullying.

The risk and protective factors included gender, internet use, self-esteem, dark triad traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy), school bullying perpetration, school bullying victimization, interparental conflict, and school climate. Results: The results of multinomial logistic regression showed that being male, school bullying perpetration, and school bullying victimization can significantly increase the chances of being a cyberbully-victim and spending one hour or less on the internet can significantly decrease the chances of being a cyberbully-victim. Conclusion: This study provides important implications for any prevention and intervention programs for cyberbullying, which must consider the roles of traditional bullying, gender differences, and internet use in cyberbullying behavior.

Myriad studies and meta-analytic reviews have confirmed the deleterious psychological and behavioral consequences of being cyber-victimized. We argue that one method to curtail such effects is to inform interventions aimed at reducing cyberbullying perpetration regarding the why and for whom cyberbullying is likely. This review expands on these issues and emphasizes the Barlett Gentile Cyberbullying Model (BGCM) as the only validated cyberbullying-specific theory to predict cyberbullying perpetration. Our principal thesis is that the wealth of research validating the BGCM has been with adult samples and applying the BGCM to adolescents presents both challenging and exciting research opportunities for future research and intervention development in youth. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Barlett, Bennardi, Williams and Zlupko.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.3389/fpsyg.2021.708277</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">barlett_etal21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_077</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">barlett17</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Barlett, C.P.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2017</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">From Theory to Practice: Cyberbullying Theory and Its Application to Intervention</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Computers in Human Behavior</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyberbullying perpetration has emerged as a world-wide societal issue; however, the majority of the research testing the predictors of cyberbullying behavior and the interventions that claim to reduce cyberbullying have inadequately applied sound theoretical reasoning. To assist education administrators, intervention specialists, social scientists, and others, we review the postulates of a recently developed theory that is unique to cyberbullying \textendash{} the Barlett and Gentile Cyberbullying Model (BGCM). Specifically, we delve into the need for such a theory and how other similar theories may be inadequate in predicting cyberbullying above and beyond traditional bullying. Then we describe the learning-based theoretical foundation that helped to build the BGCM before reviewing research that validates such theoretical tenants. Finally, we conclude with how the BGCM can inform intervention efforts to hopefully reduce cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.060</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">barlett17</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_080</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">barry_etal19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Barry, C.T.; Briggs, S.M.; Sidoti, C.L.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Adolescent and Parent Reports of Aggression and Victimization on Social Media: Associations With Psychosocial Adjustment</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Journal of Child and Family Studies</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Objective: This study investigated the relations of adolescent and parent reports of adolescents' aggression and victimization on social media with self-perception (e.g., self-esteem, narcissism) and psychosocial adjustment (e.g., attention problems, conduct problems, anxiety, depression). Method: The sample consisted of 428 participants (214 parent\textendash adolescent dyads) from the United States, with adolescents ranging from 14 to 17 years of age. Results: The majority of adolescents and parents reported that the adolescents had not engaged in social media aggression or experienced victimization; however, nearly one-third of parents reported that they were ``unsure.'' Those involved in such online interactions tended to demonstrate a variety of psychosocial difficulties. Specifically, parent- and adolescent-reported aggression were associated with parent-reported inattention, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as adolescent-reported narcissism, loneliness, fear of missing out (FoMO), and lower self-esteem. Adolescent-reported victimization was associated with many parent-reported indicators of adjustment as well as adolescent-reported loneliness, FoMO, and lower self-esteem. Conclusions: Social media aggression and victimization were related to a variety of indicators of adolescent self-perception and adjustment. Importantly, adolescents who reported experiencing social media aggression and victimization tended to be viewed by their parents as more maladjusted. Implications for further research on the developmental trajectories of these relations are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/s10826-019-01445-1</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">barry_etal19</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_085</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">bjarehed21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Bj{\"a}rehed, M.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Individual and Classroom Collective Moral Disengagement in Offline and Online Bullying: A Short-Term Multilevel Growth Model Study</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Psychology in the Schools</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">This short-term longitudinal study examined whether individual moral disengagement and classroom collective moral disengagement were associated with offline and online bullying over the course of 1 year. Multilevel growth modeling with three levels was used to analyze data from a sample of 1048 Swedish students in 68 classrooms. The students completed a self-report questionnaire at two time-points separated by approximately 1 year. All students were in fifth grade (Mage = 11.5) at the first timepoint and in sixth grade (Mage = 12.6) at the second timepoint. Results showed that students reported more offline and online bullying if they had higher initial levels of individual moral disengagement and if they belonged to classrooms with higher initial levels of classroom collective moral disengagement. Also, a change in individual moral disengagement was positively associated with a change in bullying others offline and online. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

In Austria, after a lockdown was decreed on 16 March 2020, educational institutions had to switch to a patched-up distance learning approach, which has been largely maintained to date. This article delivers empirical insights from an interdisciplinary mixed-methods research study that investigated university students' perceptions of and experiences with distance learning as well as their educational (home) spaces during the pandemic in Innsbruck, Austria. It combines results from a quantitative survey conducted with 2742 students in early 2021 with a qualitative multi-method and longitudinal research study that accompanied 98 students throughout four data-collection phases in 2020. Results show a significant improvement since spring 2020 with both teachers and learners adjusting to the distance learning formats and the use of digital tools, yet students urgently desired a return to face-to-face teaching and university life, particularly for its social benefits. Strikingly, more than half of the participants wanted to maintain the option of overall distance education after the pandemic. Based on the perspectives of students, it is appropriate to demand significant changes in post-pan-demic education adapted to the era of the post-digital, for which this article gives short-term as well as medium-term recommendations. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

Although this problem has been studied extensively, there is relatively little research examining it from the angle of the dark tetrad (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and narcissism), especially across different ethnicities. In other words, this research makes original contribution by exploring the predictive ability of the dark tetrad traits in individuals of different ethnicities and their subsequent willingness to engage in cyberbullying. The study (n = 1,464) explores whether there is a positive association between the dark tetrad personality traits and cyberbullying. The results reveal that all four traits predict cyberbullying in participants from across three different ethnicities (Asian, black, and white). Furthermore, female participants score less than their male counterparts across all four traits. Researchers, academics, and legislators might potentially benefit from this research by considering focusing their interventions on helping offenders minimize the display of certain personality traits, thus taking steps toward cyberbullying reduction. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1089/cyber.2019.0172</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">brown_etal19</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_129</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">craig_etal20</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Craig, W.; {Boniel-Nissim}, M.; King, N.; Walsh, S.D.; Boer, M.; Donnelly, P.D.; {Harel-Fisch}, Y.; {Malinowska-Cie{\'s}lik}, M.; {Gaspar de Matos}, M.; Cosma, A.; {Van den Eijnden}, R.; Vieno, A.; Elgar, F.J.; Molcho, M.; Bjereld, Y.; Pickett, W.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Social Media Use and Cyber-Bullying: A Cross-National Analysis of Young People in 42 Countries</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Journal of Adolescent Health</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Purpose: Social media use (SMU) has become an intrinsic part of adolescent life. Negative consequences of SMU for adolescent health could include exposures to online forms of aggression. We explored age, gender, and cross-national differences in adolescents' engagement in SMU, then relationships between SMU and victimization and the perpetration of cyber-bullying. Methods: We used data on young people aged 11\textendash 15 years (weighted n = 180,919 in 42 countries) who participated in the 2017\textendash 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study to describe engagement in the three types of SMU (intense, problematic, and talking with strangers online) by age and gender and then in the perpetration and victimization of cyber-bullying. Relationships between SMU and cyber-bullying outcomes were estimated using Poisson regression (weighted n = 166,647 from 42 countries). Results: Variations in SMU and cyber-bullying follow developmental and gender-based patterns across countries. In pooled analyses, engagement in SMU related to cyber-bullying victimization (adjusted relative risks = 1.14 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10\textendash 1.19] to 1.48 [95\% CI: 1.42\textendash 1.55]) and perpetration (adjusted relative risk = 1.31 [95\% CI: 1.26\textendash 1.36] to 1.84 [95\% CI: 1.74\textendash 1.95]). These associations were stronger for cyber-perpetration versus cyber-victimization and for girls versus boys. Problematic SMU was most strongly and consistently associated with cyber-bullying, both for victimization and perpetration. Stratified analyses showed that SMU related to cyber-victimization in 19\%\textendash 45\% of countries and to cyber-perpetration in 38\%\textendash 86\% of countries. Conclusions: Accessibility to social media and its pervasive use has led to new opportunities for online aggression. The time adolescents spend on social media, engage in problematic use, and talk to strangers online each relate to cyber-bullying and merit public health intervention. Problematic use of social media poses the strongest and most consistent risk. \textcopyright{} 2020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.006</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">craig_etal20</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_137</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">depasquale_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">De Pasquale, C.; Martinelli, V.; Sciacca, F.; Mazzone, M.; Chiappedi, M.; Dinaro, C.; Hichy, Z.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Role of Mood States in Cyberbullying and Cybervictimization Behaviors in Adolescents</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Psychiatry Research</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyberbullying is an intentional aggressive behavior repeatedly perpetrated by a single person or a group against a peer who can not easily defend, characterized by the use of electronic forms of contact. This phenomenon is a public health concern with serious implications for adolescents' mental health. We aimed to investigate the role of gender, age, and subjective self perceived mood states in cyberbullying and victimization (being a victim of cyberbullying) behaviors. A total of 554 adolescents (293 males and 261 females, age 15.27; SD = 2.21) completed the Florence Cyber-Bullying Cyber-Victimization Scales (FCBVSs) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Older age and male gender were associated to both cyberbullying and victimization.The aggressiveness/anger (A) and confusion/bewilderment (C) factors measured by the POMS were predictors of all types of cyberbulliyng and cybervictimization behaviors; the tension/anxiety (T) factor was a predictor of all cyberbullying behaviors and of the FCBVSs impersonification subscale of cybervictimization. Subjective specific mood states may contribute to both cyberbulliyng and victimization behaviors, suggesting the potential benefit of preventive strategies addressing the recognition and management of mood states in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113908</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">depasquale_etal21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_144</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">duncan_march19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Duncan, Z.; March, E.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Using Tinder\textregistered to Start a Fire: Predicting Antisocial Use of Tinder\textregistered with Gender and the Dark Tetrad</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality and Individual Differences</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Online dating continues to grow in popularity and is associated with significant advantages; however, experiencing antisocial behaviours when online dating is a distinct possibility. The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of gender and the dark personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism in predicting perpetration of a range of antisocial behaviours on the popular dating app Tinder. It was hypothesised that the male gender and higher scores on these personality traits would predict perpetration of antisocial behaviours on Tinder. Participants (N = 587; 21\% men, 79\% women) completed an online questionnaire, including the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} Scale which was constructed to measure a range of antisocial behaviours. Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analyses revealed three forms of antisocial behaviours (General, esteem, and sexual) which explained over half of the variance (58.99\%) of variance in the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} measure. Regression analyses were run for each form of antisocial behaviour, and the predictive utility of gender and the dark traits were found to differ across the antisocial behaviours. Results of the current study support an individual differences approach to exploring antisocial behaviours online, particularly when online dating. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2019.03.014</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">duncan_march19</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_145</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">dvoryanchikov_etal20</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Dvoryanchikov, N.V.; Bovina, I.B.; Delibalt, V.V.; Dozortseva, E.G.; Bogdanovich, N.V.; Rubtsova, O.V.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Deviant Online Behavior in Adolescent and Youth Circles: In Search of a Risk Assessment Model</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Cognitive Research in Science, Engineering and Education</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The authors made an attempt to describe the problem of developing the concept of risk assessment of deviant online behavior of minors and young adults in social networks.

Approaches for risk factors assessment of deviant behavior in real life are described: the qualitative (clinical), statistical (actuarial) and structured. The article systemizes the studies of risk factors, vulnerability, and deviant patterns in the context of phenomena such as aggressive, asocial, autoaggressive, self-mutilating, suicidal, risk-taking and victim online behavior. Approaches and models of online deviant behavior are discussed; an attempt is made to build a structured model of risk assessment of deviant patterns of online behavior in the context of the cultural historical concept. On the basis of theoretical analysis, a hypothetical set of group, interindividual and intraindividual constructs is formulated, the combination of online and offline risk factors produces a model for risk assessment of deviant behavior.

Moreover, previous research has shown associations between impulsivity (or low self-control) and perpetration and victimization of cyberbullying. However, the influence of impulsivity on bystander behavior has not been investigated yet, although bystanders play an important role in bullying situations. The present study examined the relationship between impulsivity and helping behavior in bystanders of cyberbullying. To predict the likelihood of helping a victim when witnessing cyberbullying, we collected self-reported data from a representative sample of 2309 pupils, aged 9 to 17. The results suggested that more impulsive adolescents were less likely to help the cybervictim. An explanation for the findings may be that helping behavior in a cyberbullying context requires inhibitory abilities which are deficit in impulsive adolescents. These findings could be used to inform intervention strategies about which factors are associated with bystander behavior in cyberbullying and how to target these. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Inc.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.lindif.2016.03.003</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">erreygers_etal16</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_157</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">foulkes19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Foulkes, L.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Sadism: Review of an Elusive Construct</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality and Individual Differences</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Sadism is a personality trait characterised by the enjoyment of other people's pain or suffering. In this narrative literature review, I provide an overview of the sadism research to date, appraising critical issues in the current literature and highlighting future research directions. I start with the issues surrounding the definition and measurement of sadism: there is debate regarding exactly what sadism is, which has led to a number of limitations with existing measures. I then discuss the relationship between sadism and antisocial behaviour: sadism is clearly associated with cruel behaviour towards others, but its exact role in such behaviour, and the precise distinction between sadistic and non-sadistic crimes, has proved hard to characterise. I consider sadism in the context of other antagonistic personality traits \textendash{} psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism \textendash{} and throughout the review I also discuss sexual sadism, a related construct characterised by sexual arousal to others' suffering. Finally, I consider future research directions: clear definitions and measurement tools, the development of sadism in childhood and adolescence, and the evaluation of possible treatments. Sadism often motivates antisocial behaviour, which takes a significant toll on its victims; understanding exactly what sadism is, and whether it can be treated, is of vital importance. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2019.07.010</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">foulkes19</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_173</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">giumetti_etal22</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Giumetti, G.W.; Kowalski, R.M.; Feinn, R.S.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Predictors and Outcomes of Cyberbullying among College Students: A Two Wave Study</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Aggressive Behavior</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Existing research on cyberbullying has primarily focused on adolescents in cross-sectional survey studies, with less research focusing on college students or employed adults over longer periods of time. To extend this literature, the current study examined new predictors and outcomes of cyberbullying perpetration (CP) and victimization (CV) among college students from two different universities that were followed across two time points. Risk factors were measured in line with previous theoretical models, including biological or personality-related variables (e.g., low self-control, dark-side personality traits, empathy) and environmental variables (e.g., perceived social support, lack of rule clarity, and internet use). Additionally, we examined several possible outcomes of CV and CP. Results from path analyses revealed that involvement with traditional bullying (either as a perpetrator or a victim) as well as Machiavellianism significantly predicted CV and CP. With regard to the cross-lagged associations between CV and CP, we found that Time 1 CV predicted time 2 CP, but Time 1 CP did not predict Time 2 CV. That is, being a victim of cyberbullying during the Fall semester predicted involvement as a perpetrator in the Spring semester. However, being a perpetrator during the Fall semester did not predict being a victim during the Spring semester. Regarding outcomes, we found that CV significantly predicted anxiety, depression, and helping behavior, and CP significantly predicted deviant behavior, but not GPA nor alcohol consumption. These findings have practical implications for college students as well as university student support services. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1002/ab.21992</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">giumetti_etal22</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_181</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">gylfason_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Gylfason, H.F.; Sveinsdottir, A.H.; V{\'e}steinsd{\'o}ttir, V.; Sigurvinsdottir, R.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Haters Gonna Hate, Trolls Gonna Troll: The Personality Profile of a Facebook Troll</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality factors, such as the Dark Tetrad personality factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism and sadism) relate to greater online trolling. Other personality factors, such as the Big Five Personality factors, honesty\textendash humility and negative social potency, may also play a role in cyber-bullying, which is an aggressive behavior similar to trolling. The purpose of this study was to predict Facebook trolling behavior based on personality factors. A total of 139 participants com-pleted a survey on their online behavior and personality factors. Online trolling behavior positively correlated with sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, and negatively correlated with agree-ableness, conscientiousness and honesty\textendash humility. A hierarchical linear regression showed that sadism, Machiavellianism and negative social potency were the only unique predictors of online trolling behavior. Trolling was unrelated to the frequency of Facebook use and the frequency of commenting. Enjoyment of trolling fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and the trolling behavior. The results thus suggested that Facebook trolling behaviors may be motivated by enjoying the manipulation of others. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

One of the existing issues is the small effect sizes that showed that the traits outlined by the Five-Factor model are lacking the required specificity to predict specific behaviours such as SNS addiction. In light of this issue, the present research attempted to predict SNS addiction with the Dark Triad traits that have been linked to impulsivity that is central to the development of SNS addiction. In this study, a sample of 204 (Male = 77, 38\%; Female = 124, 60\%; Not mentioned = 3, 2\%; M age = 22.94, SD age = 3.43) university students in Malaysia completed the Big Five Inventory, the Short Dark Triad, and the adapted Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results indicated that SNS addiction was significantly predicted by the measured psychopathy of the Dark Triad. In predicting SNS addiction, the inclusion of the Dark Triad traits contributed significant amount of variance after controlling the Five-Factor model. Finally, the implications of the results were discussed in this manuscript. \textcopyright{} 2018, Masaryk University.

Our research's primary questions were the following: 1). Is there a significant link between relationship attachment styles and ITPV perpetration or victimization?; 2). Is there a significant link between participants' demographic and relationship characteristics (i.e., relationship length and partners' fidelity), online behavior (i.e., benign and toxic disinhibition), moral disengagement, psychological distress), and ITPV perpetration or victimization?; and 3). Did the COVID-19 pandemic increase ITPV perpetration or victimization?. We analyzed our data by creating three different groups, depending on participants' answers concerning ITPV, i.e., the overall sample, abusers' and victims' groups. Our main results suggested significant, positive correlations between ITPV perpetration and victimization, moral disengagement, psychological distress, and online disinhibition. Age negatively correlated with IPVT victimization and perpetration. We also found significant associations between participants' dominant relationship attachment style and their own and partners' cheating behavior, as well as ITPV-victimization and perpetration. Finally, 13.7\% to 23\% of participants in all three groups considered that the Covid-19 increased the frequency of ITPV behaviors (for both abusers and victims). Results are discussed considering their theoretical and practical implications for domestic violence and the potential related prevention and intervention strategies. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/s12144-021-02197-2</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">maftei_danila21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_249</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">maftei_etal22</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Maftei, A.; Holman, A.-C.; Merlici, I.-A.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Using Fake News as Means of Cyber-Bullying: The Link with Compulsive Internet Use and Online Moral Disengagement</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Computers in Human Behavior</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Online moral disengagement and cyberbullying can enhance fake news spreading.

The indirect effect of compulsive Internet use on cyberbullying through moral disengagement was significant in adolescents, but not in adults. As assumed, teenagers scored significantly higher than adults on all the primary variables. Contrary to our expectations, no significant gender differences emerged, regardless of participants' age, in terms of compulsive Internet use, moral disengagement, nor cyberbullying.

Accompanying the benefits of online dating is the potential for new, distinct forms of antisocial behaviour online, such as trolling. The current study (N = 357) sought to explore the antisocial behaviour of trolling on Location-Based Real-Time Dating applications (i.e., LBRTD apps) in an online sample of Australians sourced from the community. Specifically, we examined the role of participant's sex and of the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and impulsivity in predicting perpetration of trolling behaviours on LBRTD apps. Although there were no sex differences, the traits of psychopathy, sadism, and dysfunctional impulsivity were significantly associated with trolling behaviours. Subsequent moderation analysis revealed that dysfunctional impulsivity predicts perpetration of trolling, but only if the individual has medium or high levels of trait psychopathy. Results of the current study aid in further conceptualising the personality of the Internet ``troll''. Future research should further explore antisocial online behaviours, such as other hostile behaviour that occurs on LBRTD apps. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2017.01.025</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_etal17</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_255</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">March, E.; Grieve, R.; Clancy, E.; Klettke, B.; Van DIck, R.; Hernandez Bark, A.S.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Role of Individual Differences in Cyber Dating Abuse Perpetration</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">There is a growing research interest in cyber dating abuse (CDA). CDA includes abusive online behavior toward a current or former intimate partner, such as aggression, control, harassment, and humiliation. Despite the potential overlap and reciprocal relationship of CDA and intimate partner violence, there remains considerable paucity in research exploring predictors of this abusive online behavior. In the current study, we adopt the General Aggression Model framework and explore the role of gender, hegemonic masculinity, vulnerable narcissism, and sexual aggression myths to predict perpetration of CDA. Participants (N = 415, 51 percent women; Mage = 32.68 years) were recruited via social media advertisements and completed an anonymous, confidential online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised the Conformity to Masculine Roles Norms Inventory, the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale, the Acceptance of Modern Myths About Sexual Aggression Scale, and a modified Cyber Aggression in Relationships Scale. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that hegemonic masculinity, vulnerable narcissism, and sexual aggression myths were all significant positive predictors of perpetrating CDA. As gender was a significant predictor until the inclusion of these variables, a multiple mediation analysis was performed, indicating that both hegemonic masculinity and sexual aggression myths fully mediated the relationship between gender and perpetrating CDA. These results add to the growing body of research exploring how CDA emerges as a behavior and highlight possible implications for management and intervention. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1089/cyber.2020.0687</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_etal21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_257</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_marrington19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">March, E.; Marrington, J.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">A Qualitative Analysis of Internet Trolling</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Internet trolling is receiving increasing research attention and exploration; however, disagreement and confusion surround definitions of the behavior. In the current study, 379 participants (60 percent women) completed an online questionnaire providing qualitative responses to the following: How do you define Internet trolling? What kind of behaviors constitutes Internet trolling? Does Internet trolling differ from Internet cyberbullying? Have you ever been trolled online, and if so how did it feel? Word frequency analyses indicated that Internet trolling is most commonly characterized as an abusive aggressive behavior. Responses also highlight the subjective nature of humor in trolling depending on whether an individual has trolled. Interestingly, the groups that indicated trolling as a "bullying" behavior were the groups who had never been trolled. Results of the current study highlight the need to differentiate between "kudos" trolling and Cyber Abuse. \textcopyright{} 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1089/cyber.2018.0210</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_marrington19</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_258</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_marrington21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">March, E.; Marrington, J.Z.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Antisocial and Prosocial Online Behaviour: Exploring the Roles of the Dark and Light Triads</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Current Psychology</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303"></span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/s12144-021-01552-7</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">march_marrington21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_296</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ozdemir_bektas21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">"O}zdemir, E.Z.; Bekta{\c s}, M.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Effects of Parental Attitude and Proactive and Reactive Aggression on Cyberbullying and Victimization among Secondary School Students</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Perspectives in Psychiatric Care</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Purpose: To predict the effect of parental attitude and proactive and reactive aggression on the cyberbully, cyber victims, and cyberbully/victim among students aged 9\textendash 14 years.

Data were collected with the ``Adolescence Information Form,'' ``Parental Attitude Scale,'' ``Proactive\textendash Reactive Aggression Scale,'' and ``Cyberbully/Victim Questionnaire.'' Logistic regression analysis was used. Findings: This study was determined that proactive\textendash reactive aggression and parental attitude predicted 30.3\% of cyberbully/victim cases. Proactive aggression and Internet usage time are essential predictors of cyberbullying cases. Practice Implications: To protect and improve their children's health, children should be informed about cyberbullying, proactive\textendash reactive aggression, and the duration of Internet use. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1111/ppc.12856</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ozdemir_bektas21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_299</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">parker_etal20</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Parker, K.-E.M.; Farrell, N.; Walker, B.R.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Impact of Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory on Aggressive Behavior</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Journal of Interpersonal Violence</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Why some people, and not others, exhibit aggression remains unknown. Research points to certain personality traits being linked to either proactive or reactive aggression, or both. The current study attempts to address these gaps from the perspective of revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (rRST). Using 146 participants, results revealed Behavioral Approach System (BAS)-Impulsivity and the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) predicted proactive and reactive aggression. Defensive Fight predicted reactive aggression. BAS-Impulsivity predicted proactive aggression partially mediated by Social Dominance Orientation. These findings suggest proactive and reactive aggression are motivated by a combination of anxiety and rapid, approach-motivational personality traits. This study provides further understanding of the specific relations between rRST and aggression, is integrated into the general aggression model, and has implications for treatment of aggressive individuals. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1177/0886260520948144</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">parker_etal20</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_300</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">parlangeli_etal20</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Parlangeli, O.; Marchigiani, E.; Guidi, S.; Bracci, M.; Andreadis, A.; Zambon, R.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2020</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">I Do It Because i Feel That\ldots moral Disengagement and Emotions in Cyberbullying and Cybervictimisation</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Few studies have jointly explored the role of factors such as the use of social media, the personality characteristics of young people, the use of thinking mechanisms aimed at moral disengagement, and the emotions experienced in relation to cyberbullying and cybervictimisation behaviour. The analysis presented here, carried out through a questionnaire distributed online and filled in by 655 Italian high school students, allowed to highlight the relationships between these variables. In particular, it emerged that the phenomena of cyberbullying and cybervictimisation are related to the time spent online and to the mechanisms of moral disengagement, which in turn are related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Emotions experienced are most clearly positive in cases of cyberbullying and negative for the victims. This correspondence, however, is reversed in bullies who resort more to thoughts aimed at moral disengagement and feel more negative emotions. The same reversal seems to occur in the victims who, in correspondence with an increased use of the mechanisms of moral disengagement, report to feel more positive emotions. \textcopyright{} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/978-3-030-49570-1_20</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">parlangeli_etal20</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_301</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">paulhus_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Paulhus, D.L.; Buckels, E.E.; Trapnell, P.D.; Jones, D.N.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Screening for Dark Personalities: The Short Dark Tetrad (SD4)</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">European Journal of Psychological Assessment</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Consensus is emerging that the constellation of dark personalities should include the sadistic personality. To build a four-factor measure, we modified and extended the Short Dark Triad (SD3) measure to include sadism. A series of three studies yielded the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4), a four subscale inventory with 7 items per construct. Study 1 (N = 868) applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to a diverse 48-item pool using data collected on MTurk. A 4-factor solution revealed a separate sadism factor, as well as a shifted Dark Triad. Study 2 (N =999 students) applied EFA to a reduced 37-item set. Associations with adjustment and sex drive provided insight into unique personality dynamics of the four constructs. In Study 3 (N = 660), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the final 28 items showed acceptable fit for a four-factor solution. Moreover, the resulting 7-item subscales each showed coherent links with the Big Five and adjustment. In sum, the fourfactor structure replicated across student and community samples. Although they overlap to a moderate degree, the four subscales show distinctive correlates-even with a control for acquiescence. We also uncovered a novel link between sadism and sexuality, but no association with maladjustment. \textcopyright{} 2021 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

In general, they post comments, photos or provocative videos that do not pursue any purpose other than annoying or obtaining pleasure or fun (Brandel, 2007; Phillips, 2011). Recent studies have shown that certain personality traits are associated with the presence of such disruptive behavior. In this research, we studied normal personality traits, psychopathological traits, and dark person traits in relation to disruptive behavior. The normal personality traits were considered from the classic Five Factor Model (FFM) - Openness to experience, Conscientiousnes Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism (Costa, \&amp; McCrae, 1985); the psychopathological traits, from the latest version of the DSM - Negative Effect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition and Psychoticism (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, the so-called Dark Triad model-Narcissism, \textcopyright{} 2021, Interdisciplinaria.

This is a contemporary issue with different consequences from in-person IPV. C-IPV is a complex phenomenon triggered by a number of factors, including personality traits such as the Dark Tetrad, composed of four ``malevolent'' qualities: subclinical narcissism, Machiavellianism, subclinical psychopathy, and everyday sadism. The Dark Tetrad plays an important role in predicting the perpetration or victimization of the resulting pervasive behaviors. Although the correlations between in-person IPV and the Dark Tetrad have been studied before, to our knowledge this investigation is the first to look at the links between these four dark personality traits and C-IPV. With a sample of 1,189 participants, we measured C-IPV victimization and perpetration rates and compared the results with the Dark Tetrad profiles of the respondents. To analyze these correlations, we conducted bivariate analysis and structural equation modeling. The analysis yielded positive relations of psychopathy and narcissism with cyber controlling behaviors. Psychopathy was found to be strongly related with direct cyber aggression behaviors; sadism was mainly related with C-IPV victimization in both controlling and direct aggression, and, finally and interestingly, Machiavellianism presented negative correlations with direct cyber aggression. Remarkable is that joining sadistic personalities increased vulnerability to victimization from C-IPV direct aggression, as well as more psychopathic traits and an increased probability of perpetration. These combinations may create dangerous situations. In conclusion, we found that both C-IPV perpetrators and victims present higher scores in the dark personality traits and gender-based differences than in-person IPV actors. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1177/0886260521991307</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">pineda_etal21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_317</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">rodriguez-castro_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Rodr{\'i}guez-Castro}, Y.; {Mart{\'i}nez-Rom{\'a}n}, R.; {Alonso-Ruido}, P.; {Ad{\'a}-Lameiras}, A.; {Carrera-Fern{\'a}ndez}, M.V.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Intimate Partner Cyberstalking, Sexism, Pornography and Sexting in Adolescents: New Challenges for Sex Education</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Background: Within the context of the widespread use of technologies by adolescents, the objectives of this study were to identify the perpetrators of intimate partner cyberstalking (IPCS) in adolescents; to analyze the relationship between IPCS and gender, age, sexting behaviors, pornography consumption, and ambivalent sexism; and to investigate the influence of the study variables as predictors of IPCS and determine their moderating role. Methods: Participants were 993 Spanish students of Secondary Education, 535 girls and 458 boys with mean age 15.75 (SD = 1.47). Of the total sample, 70.3\% (n = 696) had or had had a partner. Results: Boys perform more sexting, consume more pornographic content, and have more hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes than girls. However, girls perpetrate more IPCS than boys. The results of the hierarchical multiple regression indicate that hostile sexism is a predictor of IPCS, as well as the combined effect of Gender \texttimes{} Pornography and Benevolent Sexism \texttimes{} Sexting. Conclusions: it is essential to implement sexual affective education programs in schools in which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are incorporated so that boys and girls can experience their relationships, both offline and online, in an egalitarian and violence-free way. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The study sample comprised 840 students, 423 of which were female (50.36\%), aged an average of 14.28 years. The instruments used were an ad hoc questionnaire for socioeconomic variables and bullying behaviour, an empathy questionnaire, and a personality questionnaire. Victims yielded higher scores in terms of empathic concern, while both groups, aggressors and victims, yielded similar results in terms of cognitive and affective empathy. Concerning the correlation between these variables and personality, anxiety was found to be correlated with affective empathy and empathetic concern in both groups. A correlation between cognitive empathy and impulsiveness and activity was also found in both groups. Remarkably, aggression and cognitive empathy were found to be correlated, but only among victims. Finally, experiences with classmates, anxiety, sincerity, and aggression were found to act as predictors of school bullying, while gender and aggression factors were found to act as predictors among perpetrators, but to a lesser extent, which suggests that other factors must be in place for bullying behaviour to occur. The results suggest that, although empathy levels are different in both groups, they cannot act as a predictor of bullying, especially concerning perpetrators. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

However, there has been little examination of the extent to which sadism may also be a state dependent characteristic. This research examines the extent to which sadistic interest or tendencies can be influenced through a specifically developed and very brief mood induction procedure. An anonymous online study, comprising questionnaires and a short picture-based induction procedure was completed by 323 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition by the hosting software, Qualtrics. Analysis showed that increased sadistic interest was reported by those in the experimental condition who had higher levels of baseline sadism. The findings indicate that a brief and simple procedure can be used to enhance pre-existing sadistic interest. Further research is needed to examine whether more immersive inductions produce a greater or lasting effect, and to understand the extent to which these might influence behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1016/j.paid.2020.110358</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">themelidis_davies21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_360</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">throuvala_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Throuvala, M.A.; Griffiths, M.D.; Rennoldson, M.; Kuss, D.J.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Policy Recommendations for Preventing Problematic Internet Use in Schools: A Qualitative Study of Parental Perspectives</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Parenting in the digital age has been characterized as one of the most challenging tasks of the modern era. Parents are ambivalent about their mediating role. However, problematic aspects of adolescent online use have not been adequately addressed in education. The present study investigated parental perceptions of intervention needs within schools to prevent excessive/problematic use, enhance parent\textendash child communication, and reduce family conflicts. Nine interviews with parents of adolescents residing in the UK were carried out and analyzed utilizing thematic analysis. Three main themes emerged as parental proposals: (i) schools as digital education providers and prevention hubs, (ii) provision of mental health literacy to raise awareness, resolve ambiguity regarding impacts and mitigate excessive use and impacts, and (iii) psychoeducation and upskilling. The third theme related to impacts from time spent on screens (time displacement), content-related impacts, and context-related impacts. The present study offers recommendations for media literacy during adolescence beyond e-safety (i.e., addressing interpersonal communication problems, privacy vs. disclosure issues), based on parents' views, and provides new insights for media and emotional health literacy collaboration efforts. Future work should investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of such interventions to support the emotional health of young people and prevent problematic internet use escalation. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The present chapter provides an overview of research findings and challenges involving the Dark Triad traits: narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. Possible "fourth" traits that may comprise a Dark Tetrad-greed, spite, and sadism-are also discussed, especially in relation to narcissism. This chapter also discusses dark personality trait assessment, general differences and similarities between narcissism and the abovementioned dark personality traits, and current research findings on the Dark Triad and Dark Tetrad. Key issues and controversies regarding the factor structure of the Dark Triad and the efficacy of its expansion to include other dark traits (e.g., a Dark Tetrad) are also discussed. The chapter closes discussing future directions for dark personality traits, including novel assessment methods, further validation, and narcissism's place in an expanded nomological network of dark traits. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/978-3-319-92171-6_21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">turner_webster18</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_373</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">volk_etal16</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Volk, A.A.; Farrell, A.H.; Franklin, P.; Mularczyk, K.P.; Provenzano, D.A.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2016</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Chapter 7: Adolescent Bullying in Schools: An Evolutionary Perspective</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Evolutionary Psychology</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303"></span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/978-3-319-29986-0_7</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">volk_etal16</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_374</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">volk_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Volk, A.A.; Provenzano, D.A.; Farrell, A.H.; Dane, A.V.; Shulman, E.P.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Personality and Bullying: Pathways to Adolescent Social Dominance</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Current Psychology</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The current study examined whether personality traits were related to social dominance, directly, and indirectly through bullying, in samples of Western (Canadian) and Eastern (Chinese) adolescents. Self-report measures of personality, bullying, and social dominance were completed by 442 Chinese adolescents (293 boys), ages 14 to 19 (M = 14.63, SD = 1.53), and 389 Canadian adolescents (161 boys), ages 12 to 18 (M = 14.64, SD = 1.53). It was predicted that personality traits involving arrogance and exploitativeness (i.e., low Honesty-Humility) and impulsivity (i.e., low Conscientiousness) would be indirectly associated with social dominance, through bullying, in both samples. Consistent with evolutionary psychological perspectives, Honesty-Humility was directly and indirectly related to social dominance in both samples, whereas Conscientiousness was indirectly associated through bullying in Canadian and Chinese participants. Some relations differed across cultural contexts, in line with evolutionary and ecological perspectives suggesting that the expression of predispositions toward bullying and dominance depends on the costs and benefits afforded by the environmental (cultural) context. Specifically, eXtraversion was indirectly related to social dominance through bullying only in the Chinese sample, whereas Agreeableness was directly related to social dominance only for Canadian participants. We discuss the implications of these results for future research and intervention efforts along with the need to further verify the cross-cultural validity of adolescent behavior measures. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/s12144-019-00182-4</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">volk_etal21</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_377</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">wei_chen12</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Wei, H.-S.; Chen, J.-K.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2012</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">The Moderating Effect of Machiavellianism on the Relationships between Bullying, Peer Acceptance, and School Adjustment in Adolescents</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">School Psychology International</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">This study examined the moderating effect of Machiavellianism on the relationships between bullying, peer acceptance, and school adjustment (rule-following behavior and academic performance) among 216 middle school 7th-graders in Taipei, Taiwan. The participants were divided into two groups according to their Machiavellianism. Multi-group path analysis showed that for those who were low in Machiavellianism condition, physical and verbal bullying was negatively linked to peer acceptance and academic performance while no significant association was found for the high-Machiavellianism group. Bullying was negatively, yet non-significantly, associated with rule-following behavior for both groups.

Our findings suggest the need to monitor the dark triad of personality traits and for prevention programmes against cyberbullying to consider the cultural context. \textcopyright{} 2020, \textcopyright{} 2020 Department of Social Work, National University of Singapore, Singapore.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Elsevier Scopus <br> Wed Feb 16 10:06:40 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1080/02185385.2020.1788979</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">wright_etal20</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_384</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">yoon_koo19</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Yoon, J.; Koo, K.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2019</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Implication of Cyberbullying on Under-Represented Students in Post-Secondary Education</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Cyberbullying is an emerging issue in the context of higher education as information and communication technologies increasingly become part of daily life at universities. This article offers a review of the major literature regarding cyberbullying, its victims and perpetrators, and its implications that impact disadvantaged students in higher education, specifically those who are in lower socio-economic situations. Post-secondary education has been an important pathway to guide students out of poverty by helping them lead successful lives. However, as in higher education, cyberbullying incidents have increased in educational situations, the bullied victims are more likely to report feelings of depression that cause an obstacle to their academic achievements in post-secondary education. The anonymous environments associated in cyberbullying can cause immorality of the cyberbullying perpetrators. To prevent cyberbullying on campus, this article provides cyberbullying rules and policies and suggests specialized treatment and interventions for cyber-bullies as a solution.

While some of these behaviours are clearly antisocial and, in extreme cases, criminal, others are harmless and may even have potential prosocial functions. This study is an attempt to disambiguate some of the competing and contrary interpretations of internet trolling by examining the perspectives of avid internet users for whom trolling is a familiar part of their online lives. Through data collected from in-depth, semi-structured interviews, a multifaceted picture of trolling emerges that is at odds with previous media characterizations of internet trolls as merely hateful bullies. On the contrary, most participants in this study did not consider trolling to be a serious problem and many did not consider harmful interactions to be trolling at all. This paper describes some of the defining characteristics of internet trolling in order to differentiate the harmful behaviours from the harmless. This work aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on internet trolling in the hopes of informing regulatory policy and educational initiatives concerning internet use and safety.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Trolling, antisocial internet behaviour, internet communication, internet memes, internet culture, digital literacy</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Wiley Ebooks <br> Wed Feb 16 10:07:13 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a27f"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.2018.14505501009</span></p></td></tr><tr style="overflow-wrap:break-word;"><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ref_415</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">bonilla-zorita_etal21</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">ARTICLE</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Bonilla-Zorita}, Gabriel; Griffiths, Mark D.; Kuss, Daria J.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">2021</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Online Dating and Problematic Use: A Systematic Review</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Despite the constant growth in the use of online dating sites and mobile dating applications, research examining potential problematic use of online dating has remained scarce. Previous research has obviated problematic use of online dating in favour of users' personality correlates and scams through online dating services. A systematic review was carried out using PsycINFO and Web of Science databases to gather previous findings that address potential problematic use of online dating by (i) identifying use and motivations, (ii) assessing users' personality correlates, (iii) outlining negative correlates of use, (iv) examining sexual and impulsive behaviour, (v) exploring substance use and behavioural addictions in relation to online dating, and (vi) examining problematic use of online dating, resulting in 43 studies. Findings suggest that personality correlates such as neuroticism, sociability, sensation-seeking, and sexual permissiveness are related to greater use of online dating services. Sex-search and self-esteem enhancement are predictors of problematic use of online dating. Previous research coincides with online dating risks (e.g. fear of deception) and objectification tendency due to online dating services (sites and apps) design. Observations regarding methodological weaknesses and future research implications are included.</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303"></span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">Springer Link<br> Wed Feb 16 10:07:20 2022</span></p></td><td class="cl-25d5a280"><p class="cl-25d46a12"><span class="cl-25d44303">10.1007/s11469-020-00318-9</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
