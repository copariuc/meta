  abstract = {The current crises in Syria has led to a number of Britons travelling abroad to fight with groups such as Isis. Capitalising on this growth, Isis are now increasingly fighting an online cyber war, with the use of slick videos, online messages of hate and even an app that all aim to radicalise and create a new generation of cyber jihadists. These modern day tools are helping Isis spread their propaganda and ideology to thousands of online sympathisers across the world. Indeed, the group has actively been using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to recruit new would be members. This is being done through images and the streaming of violent online viral videos filmed and professionally edited that are targeting young and impressionable people. Portraying a glamorised and `cool' image, Isis fighters are beginning to act as the new rock stars of global cyber jihad. The Internet therefore is becoming the virtual playground for extremist views to be reinforced and act as an echo chamber. This study analysed 100 different Facebook pages and 50 Twitter user accounts which generated over 2050 results and helped the author create a typology of seven key behaviour characteristics and motivations. The findings in this study confirmed the author's original hypothesis, i.e. online hate is being used by groups such as Isis for a variety of reasons such as recruitment and propaganda. Moreover, this material is coordinated and controlled by Isis as a means for publishing and sending out key messages.},

Previous research has obviated problematic use of online dating in favour of users' personality correlates and scams through online dating services. A systematic review was carried out using PsycINFO and Web of Science databases to gather previous findings that address potential problematic use of online dating by (i) identifying use and motivations, (ii) assessing users' personality correlates, (iii) outlining negative correlates of use, (iv) examining sexual and impulsive behaviour, (v) exploring substance use and behavioural addictions in relation to online dating, and (vi) examining problematic use of online dating, resulting in 43 studies. Findings suggest that personality correlates such as neuroticism, sociability, sensation-seeking, and sexual permissiveness are related to greater use of online dating services. Sex-search and self-esteem enhancement are predictors of problematic use of online dating. Previous research coincides with online dating risks (e.g. fear of deception) and objectification tendency due to online dating services (sites and apps) design. Observations regarding methodological weaknesses and future research implications are included.},

However, despite the growth in literature and researchers' interests, there are no reviews on this topic. This study comprehensively explores the current research progress and tendencies, particularly the thematic structure of sentic computing, to provide insights into the issues addressed during the past decade and the potential future of sentic computing. We combined bibliometric analysis and structural topic modeling to examine sentic computing literature in various aspects, including the tendency of annual article count, top journals, countries/regions, institutions, and authors, the scientific collaborations between major contributors, as well as the major topics and their tendencies. We obtained interesting and meaningful findings. For example, sentic computing has attracted growing interest in academia. In addition, Cognitive Computation and Nanyang Technological University were found to be the most productive journal and institution in publishing sentic computing studies, respectively. Moreover, important issues such as cyber issues and public opinion, deep neural networks and personality, financial applications and user profiles, and affective and emotional computing have been commonly addressed by authors focusing on sentic computing. Our study provides a thorough overview of sentic computing, reveals major concerns among scholars during the past decade, and offers insights into the future directions of sentic computing research.},

Vast research has been carried out on this topic around the world however there has not been enough research that is New Zealand based. The objective of this research is to identify the characteristics of cyber victims on social media in New Zealand. We scrutinize the prevalence of cyberbullying in New Zealand among university students based on age, gender and personality. The survey was designed stating the hypotheses developed as a result of the literature review. We gathered the data of sample size n = 158. We conclude that students with openness to experience are more likely to be cyberbullied compared to the other personalities. Whereas, we found no correlation of age and gender with the cyber bullying on a university level. The results from this study can have a positive application in counter cyberbullying programs in New Zealand. This study will a give an impetus for further analytical research in the field of cyber bullying in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Research has shown that while traditional (e.g., physical and relational) and cyber aggression and victimization often co-occur, individuals may differ in terms of their experiences with aggression and victimization as well as social-psychological adjustment. The current study investigated whether there are distinct groups of college students who experience different forms of aggression and victimization using latent profile analysis (LPA), and whether these groups differ from one another in their maladaptive personality characteristics and psychopathology symptoms. Participants were 540 undergraduate students from a Midwestern university (53\% female; 78.5\% White; average age\,=\,19.27~years). Four profiles were identified: Non-Involved (80.7\%), Traditional Victim-Only (10.3\%), Traditional Aggressor/Victim (4.8\%), and Combined Aggressor/Victim (traditional aggression, cyber aggression and victimization; 4.1\%). Maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology symptoms differed across the four groups. Both the traditional aggressor/victim group and the combined aggressor/victim group, compared to the non-involved and traditional victim-only group, reported higher levels of narcissism, psychopathy, and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. The traditional aggressor/victim group, compared to the combined aggressor/victim group, reported higher levels of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and CU traits. The combined aggressor/victim group reported higher levels of psychopathology symptoms (i.e., emotion dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and stress) compared to the traditional aggressor/victim group. These findings enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity in experiences with aggression and victimization among college students, and highlight the importance of developing interventions that target their specific mental health needs.},

The purpose of the article is to examine the research trend and distribution of publications by five main fields, including time, productive authors, prominent sources, active institutions, and leading countries/regions. Furthermore, this study aims to determine the global collaborations and current gaps in research of cybercrime victimization. Findings indicated the decidedly upward trend of publications in the given period. The USA and its authors and institutions were likely to connect widely and took a crucial position in research of cybercrime victimization. Cyberbullying was identified as the most concerned issue over the years and cyber interpersonal crimes had the large number of research comparing to cyber-dependent crimes. Future research is suggested to concern more about sample of the elder and collect data in different countries which are not only European countries or the USA. Cross-nation research in less popular continents in research map was recommended to be conducted more. This paper contributed an overview of scholarly status of cybercrime victimization through statistical evidence and visual findings; assisted researchers to optimize their own research direction; and supported authors and institutions to build strategies for research collaboration.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of problematic social media use (PSMU) with Dark Triad (DT) traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism) and self-esteem. A total of 827 university students [495 (60\%) women and 332 (40\%) men, Mage\,=\,20.36, SD\,=\,1.47] filled out a questionnaire that included the Social Media Disorder Scale, Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Scale, and Single Item Self-esteem Scale. The direct effects of DT traits and self-esteem on PSMU and the indirect effect of narcissism on PSMU through self-esteem were investigated by applying structural equation modeling. Results indicated that, when controlling for gender and age, Machiavellianism and narcissism had small significant direct effects on PSMU, while the partial indirect link of narcissism via self-esteem was negligible. The model was able to explain 18\% of the variance. Results were discussed in the light of existing literature.},

In particular, the first task aims to predict if a particular action is aggressive or not based on the analysis of different features. In turn, the second and the third task investigate the cyberbullying problem by identifying users' role in the exchanged message or assigning a severity score to a given users or session respectively. Nevertheless, information heterogeneity, due to different multimedia contents (i.e. text, emojis, stickers or gifs), and the use of datasets, which are typically unlabeled or manually labelled, create continuous challenges in addressing the cyberbullying problem.},

This is because they help overcome physical limitations and save time and energy by doing everything online. The rapid growth in this tendency has created the need for extra protection, by creating new rules and policies. However, sometimes users interrupt these rules and policies through unethical behavior. For example, bullying on social media platforms is a type of cyber victimization that can cause serious harm to individuals, leading to suicide. A firm step towards protecting the cyber society from victimization is to detect the topics that trigger the feeling of being a victim. In this paper, the focus is on Twitter, but it can be expanded to other platforms. The proposed method discovers cyber victimization by detecting the type of behavior leading to them being a victim. It consists of a text classification model, that is trained with a collected dataset of the official news since 2000, about suicide, self-harm, and cyberbullying. Results show that LinearSVC performs slightly better with an accuracy of 96\%.},

Cybercrime has emerged as a money-driven industry with malicious intent towards online social networks. Cyber-criminals aim to manipulate vulnerable areas in cyberspace by playing on human understanding and making a profit. They threaten minors, especially adolescents, who are not adequately overseen while online. To address this issue, there is an urgent need for a robust content-based cybercrime detection framework. The aim of this research work is to explore possible combinations of various preprocessing, feature selection and classification methodologies using the cuckoo search metaheuristic approach. This approach seeks to improve the performance of content-based cybercrime detection system. For the purpose of this research, four publicly available datasets for cyberbullying detection have been utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was then further compared with three recent cyberbullying detection models based on various evaluation parameters. These parameters included precision, recall and f-measure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach outperformed other recent techniques on all the datasets, giving high predictive recall value via tenfold cross-validation.},

Composite reliability and McDonald's omega proved the very good internal consistency of the BSMAS-RO. The CFA highlighted the unifactorial model fitted well and measurement invariance across gender was revealed. Females obtained significantly higher scores on social media addiction (SMA) than males. As for concurrent validity, SMA correlated with social media intensity use, anxious attachment, social anxiety, need to belong, self-esteem, and happiness. IRT analysis proved adequate discrimination and difficulty parameters for all items. The highest discrimination was registered by salience criterion and the highest difficulty by conflict, withdrawal, and mood modification criteria. Relapse criterion had the lowest values of both parameters. Network analysis revealed that salience and withdrawal criteria had the highest indicators of centrality and relapse the lowest. Our findings revealed that the most relevant criteria to the diagnosis of SMA in Romanian people are salience, conflict, withdrawal, and mood modification. The robust psychometric properties of the BSMAS-RO provide health professionals a valid instrument for assessing SMA. Programs to prevent SMA must focus on dispositional traits as AATT, social anxiety, respectively unsatisfied need to belong, and promoting the ability to initiate and maintain rewarding social relationships.},

This insecure environment of OSN needs attention to prevent the damage caused by these crimes to society. Cyberbullying is reported as one of the harmful crimes causing psychological damage to victims. Cyberbullying has dangerous effects on the victim, which may also lead the victim to suicidal attempt. Victims of cyberbullying are usually afraid or embarrassed to reveal about their harassment. It has become a necessity to detect and prevent cyberbullying. Many researchers are working in multiple directions to achieve best results for automated cyberbullying detection.

In this work, we show how big five personality traits are correlated to the violent behavior of the cyber-violence perpetrator. We use a set of ensemble learning algorithms with engineered features related to the vocabulary used in each Big Five personality trait namely, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness. The findings show a significant association between the individuals' personality state and the harmful intention. This result can be a good indicator of online users' susceptibility to cyber-violence and therefore can help in dealing with it.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the prevalence of cyberbullying and the mediating effect of moral disengagement in the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and cyberbullying. We recruited 655 undergraduates to complete the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Moral Disengagement Scale, and Cyberbullying Questionnaire. The results revealed: (1) significant gender differences in cyberbullying, with males reporting more cyberbullying than females in all three dimensions: perpetration, victimization, and bystander behavior; (2) agreeableness was negatively related to engaging in perpetration, victimization, and bystander behavior, whereas neuroticism was only positively related to bystander behavior; and (3) moral disengagement played a partially mediating role in the relationship between neuroticism and bystander behavior, as well as the relationship between agreeableness and bystander behavior. Moreover, moral disengagement played a totally mediating role in the relationship between agreeableness and engagement in perpetration, as well as the relationship between agreeableness and involvement in victimization.},
