  abstract = {This paper presents a cyberbullying detection model based on user personality, determined by the Big Five and Dark Triad models. The model aims to recognize bullying patterns among Twitter communities, based on relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. Random Forest, a well-known machine-learning algorithm was used for cyberbullying classification (i.e. aggressor, spammer, bully and normal), applied in conjunction with a baseline algorithm encompassing seven Twitter features (i.e. number of mentions, number of followers and following, popularity, favorite count, status count and number of hash tags). Findings indicate that factoring user's personality greatly improves cyberbullying detection mechanisms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Big Five), and psychopathy (Dark Triad) were found to be significant in detecting bullies, achieving up to 96\% (precision) and 95\% (recall). The emergence of significant personality traits in an experimental study supports existing empirical studies that show the relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidences linking users psychological features such as personality traits and cybercrimes such as cyberbullying are many. This study deals with automatic cyberbullying detection mechanism tapping into Twitter users' psychological features including personalities, sentiment and emotion. User personalities were determined using Big Five and Dark Triad models, whereas machine learning classifiers namely, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and J48 were used to classify the tweets into one of four categories: bully, aggressor, spammer and normal. The Twitter dataset contained 5453 tweets gathered using the hashtag \#Gamergate, and manually annotated by human experts. Selected Twitter-based features namely text, user and network-based features were used as the baseline algorithm. Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Other personality factors, such as the Big Five Personality factors, honesty-humility and negative social potency, may also play a role in cyberbullying, which is an aggressive behavior similar to trolling. The purpose of this study was to predict Facebook trolling behavior based on personality factors. A total of 139 participants completed a survey on their online behavior and personality factors. Online trolling behavior positively correlated with sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, and negatively correlated with agreeableness, conscientiousness and honesty-humility. A hierarchical linear regression showed that sadism, Machiavellianism and negative social potency were the only unique predictors of online trolling behavior. Trolling was unrelated to the frequency of Facebook use and the frequency of commenting. Enjoyment of trolling fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and the trolling behavior. The results thus suggested that Facebook trolling behaviors may be motivated by enjoying the manipulation of others.},

  abstract = {Purpose The widespread use of information and communication technologies enables consumers to obtain and share information whenever they feel the urge. With the advent of review websites and forums, companies and business owners may find themselves victims of consumer cyber aggression, which can hurt a company badly. This study aims to explore why consumers would engage in cyber aggression against companies, and to that end, it examines consumers' ethical orientation and other possible drivers of cyber aggression. Design/methodology/approach To examine how ethical orientation affects consumers' intention to engage in cyber aggression, a scenario-based 2 x 2 (deontological: moral/immoral x teleological: good result/bad result) between-subject experimental design is used. Moreover, 26 possible drivers in related literature are identified and included in a questionnaire administered to 226 college students. Findings The results show that adult consumers' deontological and teleological evaluations significantly affect their ethical judgment about engaging in cyber aggression, which further impacts their intention to perpetrate an act of cyber aggression. Moreover, the study identifies six factors contributing to cyber aggression engagement as follows: personal aggressiveness, ease of perpetration, internet negativity, personal gains, helping the company and recreation. Originality/value Cyber aggression is generally viewed as interpersonal violence among adolescents. This study views cyber aggression from a different perspective and it is one of the few studies to look at adult consumers' motivations to engage in cyber aggression against companies. The findings of this study can help firms understand why their customers attack them online, and understanding that will enable businesses to formulate more effective responses to attacks.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that a small minority of social media users experience problems as a result of their online use. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association of cyberbullying perpetration and problematic social media use with childhood emotional trauma, Cluster B (narcissistic, histrionic, antisocial, and borderline) personality traits, dissociative experiences (DEs), depression, and self-esteem in a nonclinical undergraduate sample. A total of 344 university students volunteered to complete a questionnaire that included measures on the aforementioned dimensions. Thirty-eight percent of the participants had emotional neglect and 27\% had emotional abuse, while 44\% of them demonstrated at least one cyberbullying perpetration behavior. Results indicated that cyberbullying perpetrators had higher scores on problematic social media use, dissociative experiences, Cluster B traits, depression and childhood emotional trauma, and lower on self-esteem. Path analysis demonstrated that, while adjusting for gender and age, childhood emotional trauma was directly and indirectly associated with cyberbullying perpetration via Cluster B traits. Moreover, depression and dissociation were directly associated with problematic social media use. The findings of this study emphasize the important direct role of childhood emotional trauma and pathological personality traits on cyberbullying perpetration.},

  abstract = {Fueled by tragic incidents worldwide, many studies have investigated dispositional factors that lead to virtual abuse and cyberbullying. In contrast to this, less extreme forms of uncivil online behavior have received only little attention. The current paper strives to overcome this research gap by focusing on uncivil commenting intentions in public Facebook discussions. We presented controversial online comments to a convenient student sample of 256 Facebook users asking them to consider their likely response on several scales ranging from a functional to an uncivil style of reasoning. Users' intended commenting was then linked to several personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) and their Facebook intensity. Analyses revealed openness, agreeableness, and experience seeking as negative predictors of participants' intention to comment uncivilly, whereas attentional impulsivity, boredom susceptibility as well as intense Facebook use emerged as positive predictors. No connections were found for the Dark Triad. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objective of the present work was to observe the properties of the Buckels, Trapnell, \& Paulhus's Trolling Questionnaire (2014). Two samples were constituted, one of 437 subjects and other of 532 participants, both samples from Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires. An exploratory factorial analysis -using the first sample- and a confirmatory -using the second one- indicated a unifactorial structure and measurement invariance. Internal consistency was adequate: Cronbach's alpha = .74, and a composite reliability of .81. Concurrent validity of the Trolling Questionnaire was observed with the problematic use of new technologies and dark personality: Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychotism. In the discussion the implications of these findings.},

  abstract = {Celebrities are increasingly utilizing social media platforms to establish their brand and interact with their fan base, but in doing so they often become the targets of online abuse. While such abusive acts are known to cause severe consequences in the general population little is known about how celebrity abuse is perceived by observers. This study investigated observers' impressions of the severity of online abuse on Twitter, the blame attributed to celebrities for the abuse they received, and the role of the dark triad of observers' personality factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) in these decisions. We manipulated celebrity tweet content (negative, neutral, positive) and the volume of abusive comments (high, low) the tweets received. Celebrities received more blame the more negative their initial tweet was, and incidents were perceived as least severe following a negative tweet with a high volume of abuse. Observer impressions were influenced by their dark triad personality factors. Following negative tweets, as observer narcissism increased, victim blame increased and perceived severity decreased. Following positive tweets, as observer psychopathy increased, perceived severity decreased. Results are discussed in the context of the Warranting Theory of online impression formation and the ramifications for celebrity social media use are explored.},

  abstract = {Twitter enables millions of active users to send and read concise messages on the internet every day. Yet some people use Twitter to propagate violent and threatening messages resulting in cyberbullying. Previous research has focused on whether cyberbullying behavior exists or not in a tweet (binary classification). In this research, we developed a model for detecting the severity of cyberbullying in a tweet. The developed model is a feature-based model that uses features from the content of a tweet, to develop a machine learning classifier for classifying the tweets as non-cyberbullied, and low, medium, or high-level cyberbullied tweets. In this study, we introduced pointwise semantic orientation as a new input feature along with utilizing predicted features (gender, age, and personality type) and Twitter API features. Results from experiments with our proposed framework in a multi-class setting are promising both with respect to Kappa (84\%), classifier accuracy (93\%), and F-measure (92\%) metric. Overall, 40\% of the classifiers increased performance in comparison with baseline approaches. Our analysis shows that features with the highest odd ratio: for detecting low-level severity include: age group between 19-22 years and users with {$<$}1 year of Twitter account activation; for medium-level severity: neuroticism, age group between 23-29 years, and being a Twitter user between one to two years; and for high-level severity: neuroticism and extraversion, and the number of times tweet has been favorited by other users. We believe that this research using a multi-class classification approach provides a step forward in identifying severity at different levels (low, medium, high) when the content of a tweet is classified as cyberbullied. Lastly, the current study only focused on the Twitter platform; other social network platforms can be investigated using the same approach to detect cyberbullying severity patterns.},

Social networking sites (SNSs) such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other services with user-generated content (UGC), provide a platform to facilitate these types of behavior. While these SNSs encourage respectful or acceptable behavior and adherence to conduct standards, incidences of obscene language, personal attacks, cyberbullying, racial, gender or sexual bias, and hate speech are rampant. Prior research suggests that this type of unacceptable or deviant behavior can be attributed to Dark Triad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). Using the lens of the Dark Triad and an extensive literature review, a Short Dark Triad (SD3) survey study was conducted to investigate the gap in Information Systems (IS) research and the influence of deviant behaviors and its acceptance in SNSs.},
