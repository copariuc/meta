  abstract = {This paper presents a cyberbullying detection model based on user personality, determined by the Big Five and Dark Triad models. The model aims to recognize bullying patterns among Twitter communities, based on relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. Random Forest, a well-known machine-learning algorithm was used for cyberbullying classification (i.e. aggressor, spammer, bully and normal), applied in conjunction with a baseline algorithm encompassing seven Twitter features (i.e. number of mentions, number of followers and following, popularity, favorite count, status count and number of hash tags). Findings indicate that factoring user's personality greatly improves cyberbullying detection mechanisms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Big Five), and psychopathy (Dark Triad) were found to be significant in detecting bullies, achieving up to 96\% (precision) and 95\% (recall). The emergence of significant personality traits in an experimental study supports existing empirical studies that show the relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying.},

We also sought to design a reliable measure of bullying for use with an adult sample. The sample consisted of 657 participants (203 males; 454 females), aged 18 to 70 (M=23.1, SD=8.65). Participants completed the Short-D3, a measure of the Dark Triad personality traits, as well as a Bullying Questionnaire which was constructed for this study. Correlational analyses demonstrated that psychopathy was most strongly related to bullying, followed by Machiavellianism, and narcissism. However, our predictions for the differential correlations between the Dark Triad facets and bullying type were generally not supported. Implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cyberbullying is a growing problem in the fast-evolving world of social media. Although this problem has been studied extensively, there is relatively little research examining it from the angle of the dark tetrad (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and narcissism), especially across different ethnicities. In other words, this research makes original contribution by exploring the predictive ability of the dark tetrad traits in individuals of different ethnicities and their subsequent willingness to engage in cyberbullying. The study (n\,=\,1,464) explores whether there is a positive association between the dark tetrad personality traits and cyberbullying. The results reveal that all four traits predict cyberbullying in participants from across three different ethnicities (Asian, black, and white). Furthermore, female participants score less than their male counterparts across all four traits. Researchers, academics, and legislators might potentially benefit from this research by considering focusing their interventions on helping offenders minimize the display of certain personality traits, thus taking steps toward cyberbullying reduction.},

The current study explored personality traits and social motivations associated with individuals who engage in online trolling, specifically on the SNS Facebook\textregistered. The Dark Tetrad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and social reward (specifically, negative social potency) were examined for their predictive utility of trolling behaviours on Facebook\textregistered. A sample of 396 adults (75.9\% women, 24.1\% men) aged between 18 and 77years of age (M=34.41, SD=1.70) completed the Global Assessment of Facebook\textregistered{} Trolling (GAFT), The Dirty Dozen, The Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, and The Social Rewards Questionnaire. Results showed that trait psychopathy and sadism predict Facebook\textregistered{} trolling behaviours; however, negative social potency had the strongest predictive utility. These results show that individual trolling behaviour may be better explained by negative social reward motivation than negative personality traits. In addition, these findings offer practical implications for SNS administrators and everyday users of SNSs. Future research should continue to explore predictors of this understudied antisocial online behaviour.},

  abstract = {Previous research into Twitter cyberabuse has yielded several findings: victim-blaming (VB) was influenced by victims' initial tweet-valence; perceived severity (PS) was influenced independently by tweet valence and abuse volume; VB and PS were predicted by observer narcissism and psychopathy. However, this previous research was limited by its narrow focus on celebrity victims, and lack of consideration of observer sadism. The current study investigated 125 observers' VB and PS perceptions of lay-user cyberabuse, and influence of observers' Dark Tetrad scores (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, sadism). We manipulated initial-tweet valence (negative, neutral, positive) and received abuse volume (low, high). Our results indicated that VB was highest following negative initial tweets; VB was higher following high-volume abuse. PS did not differ across initial-tweet valences; PS was greater following a high abuse volume. Regression analyses revealed that observer sadism predicted VB across initial-tweet valences; psychopathy predicted PS when initial tweets were `emotive' (negative, positive), whereas Machiavellianism predicted PS when they were neutral. Our results show that perceptions of lay-user abuse are influenced interactively by victim-generated content and received abuse volume. Our current results contrast with perceptions of celebrity-abuse, which is mostly determined by victim-generated content. Findings are contextualised within the Warranting Theory of impression formation.},

Among a sample of 761 participants, we investigated direct and indirect associations of the Dark Tetrad traits with PSMU via cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and cybertrolling. Multiple mediation analyses demonstrated cyberbullying and cyberstalking fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and PSMU in the total sample and among men. Narcissism was indirectly associated with PSMU via cyberstalking in the total sample and among women. The relationship between sadism and PSMU was fully explained by cyberbullying and cyberstalking in the total sample. Cybertrolling was associated with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, although it was not related to PSMU. We suggest that antisocial online behaviors may provide an explanation for the relationship between dark personality traits and PSMU with different behaviors mediating different traits among men and women.},
