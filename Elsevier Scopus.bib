  abstract = {This paper presents a cyberbullying detection model based on user personality, determined by the Big Five and Dark Triad models. The model aims to recognize bullying patterns among Twitter communities, based on relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. Random Forest, a well-known machine-learning algorithm was used for cyberbullying classification (i.e. aggressor, spammer, bully and normal), applied in conjunction with a baseline algorithm encompassing seven Twitter features (i.e. number of mentions, number of followers and following, popularity, favorite count, status count and number of hash tags). Findings indicate that factoring user's personality greatly improves cyberbullying detection mechanisms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Big Five), and psychopathy (Dark Triad) were found to be significant in detecting bullies, achieving up to 96\% (precision) and 95\% (recall). The emergence of significant personality traits in an experimental study supports existing empirical studies that show the relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Empirical evidences linking users' psychological features such as personality traits and cybercrimes such as cyberbullying are many. This study deals with automatic cyberbullying detection mechanism tapping into Twitter users' psychological features including personalities, sentiment and emotion. User personalities were determined using Big Five and Dark Triad models, whereas machine learning classifiers namely, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest and J48 were used to classify the tweets into one of four categories: bully, aggressor, spammer and normal. The Twitter dataset contained 5453 tweets gathered using the hashtag \#Gamergate, and manually annotated by human experts. Selected Twitter-based features namely text, user and network-based features were used as the baseline algorithm. Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2020},

  abstract = {Research has shown that celebrity and lay victims are attributed blame for cyberabuse incidents. The nature of victim-generated content and abuse volume contribute to victim blame (VB) and perceived severity (PS) of incidents. Complementary cyberbullying research demonstrates that perceived attractiveness co-varies with VB, suggesting a protective `halo' related to the `what is beautiful is good' phenomenon. To explore the inter-relationships between victim status (celebrity, lay-user), victim identity claims (initial tweets: negative, neutral, positive), and behavioral residue (abuse volume: low, high), we used a mixed-factors design; victim status was a between-groups factor, whereas initial tweet valence and abuse volume were within-participants factors. We measured perceptions of victim attractiveness, VB, and PS; additionally, we measured participants' (N = 309) Dark Triad traits. In general, we found that celebrities received less blame than lay-users, and abuse against celebrities was perceived as more-severe. An exception was when celebrities initially tweeted negative content, in which case they received more blame. VB was influenced by social attractiveness, victim status, and initial tweet valence. PS was determined by abuse volume, task attractiveness, and initial tweet valence. Celebrities appear to be held in higher regard and considered more attractive than other social media users, affording them protection when abused online. \textcopyright{} 2021},

  abstract = {Fueled by tragic incidents worldwide, many studies have investigated dispositional factors that lead to virtual abuse and cyberbullying. In contrast to this, less extreme forms of uncivil online behavior have received only little attention. The current paper strives to overcome this research gap by focusing on uncivil commenting intentions in public Facebook discussions. We presented controversial online comments to a convenient student sample of 256 Facebook users asking them to consider their likely response on several scales ranging from a functional to an uncivil style of reasoning. Users' intended commenting was then linked to several personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) and their Facebook intensity. Analyses revealed openness, agreeableness, and experience seeking as negative predictors of participants' intention to comment uncivilly, whereas attentional impulsivity, boredom susceptibility as well as intense Facebook use emerged as positive predictors. No connections were found for the Dark Triad. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Celebrities are increasingly utilizing social media platforms to establish their brand and interact with their fan base, but in doing so they often become the targets of online abuse. While such abusive acts are known to cause severe consequences in the general population little is known about how celebrity abuse is perceived by observers. This study investigated observers' impressions of the severity of online abuse on Twitter, the blame attributed to celebrities for the abuse they received, and the role of the dark triad of observers' personality factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) in these decisions. We manipulated celebrity tweet content (negative, neutral, positive) and the volume of abusive comments (high, low) the tweets received. Celebrities received more blame the more negative their initial tweet was, and incidents were perceived as least severe following a negative tweet with a high volume of abuse. Observer impressions were influenced by their dark triad personality factors. Following negative tweets, as observer narcissism increased, victim blame increased and perceived severity decreased. Following positive tweets, as observer psychopathy increased, perceived severity decreased. Results are discussed in the context of the Warranting Theory of online impression formation and the ramifications for celebrity social media use are explored. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Many aspects of the Internet have been described as taking a ``dark turn'', as incidents of spear-phishing, identity theft, and other known cyber threats are becoming more commonplace. Social networking sites (SNSs) such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other services with user-generated content (UGC), provide a platform to facilitate these types of behavior. While these SNSs encourage respectful or acceptable behavior and adherence to conduct standards, incidences of obscene language, personal attacks, cyberbullying, racial, gender or sexual bias, and hate speech are rampant. Prior research suggests that this type of unacceptable or deviant behavior can be attributed to Dark Triad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). Using the lens of the Dark Triad and an extensive literature review, a Short Dark Triad (SD3) survey study was conducted to investigate the gap in Information Systems (IS) research and the influence of deviant behaviors and its acceptance in SNSs. \textcopyright{} 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.
