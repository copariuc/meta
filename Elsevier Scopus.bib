There is a limited understanding of the factors leading to the addiction of young social media users, the consequences of experiencing addiction, and the measures/mechanisms used by parents and platform providers to limit/prevent problematic social media use amongst young users. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature concerning these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) protocol was used to evaluate and present the results. A total of 45 studies were screened and independently reviewed against predetermined criteria for eligibility. Findings: The results revealed four categories of young users' addiction to social media networks (social, technological, behavioural and mental). Several prevention approaches directed at parents and platform providers were discussed. Originality/value: This study offers important insights for health policy makers, platform providers, parents and researchers on designing interventions addressing social media addiction amongst young users. It also provides an in-depth understanding of the conceptualization of social media addiction and suggestions on possible actions to prevent it. \textcopyright{} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the 13 regions in Saudi Arabia. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to measure the reliability and validity of the study's constructs and a structural equation modeling technique was applied to test the study hypotheses. Findings: With a sample of 450 users, the regression results indicate a less significant relationship between personality and social media use, as well as between personality and affective empathy, while a more significant relationship between personality and cognitive empathy. Also, individuals' well-being are influenced directly by the heavy use of social media. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design used in this research may not be able to provide the true essence of the hypothesized relationships compared to the cause-effect design. This study furthers the understanding of the role of personality on empathy and well-being in social media among Saudis from one side and provides insights to professionals for better improvement of social media and so better individuals' well-being from the other side. Originality/value: This paper fills an untapped gap in a developing country context by exploring the relationship between the usage of social media and the two dimensions of empathy, which, in turn, influence well-being under the theoretical lens of an FFM personality. \textcopyright{} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

In this study, an incidental sample 624 adolescents (55\% girls, 45\% boys, ranging between 12 and 19 years of age was evaluated on two occasions separated by a one-year period, to measure cyberbullying, as well as possible personality predictors (big five, attachment styles) and possible psychosocial outcomes (selfesteem, emotional well-being, drug use and aggressive behaviour). The results indicate that low agreeableness predicts an increase in cyberaggression while fearful/preoccupied attachment predicts an increase in cybervictimization. In addition, cyberaggression predicts a decrease in self-esteem and an increase in alcohol consumption; cybervictimization predicts an increase in alcohol and tobacco consumption. Therefore, this study suggests that predictors of cyberbullying can be identified, and that cyberbullying is associated with unfavourable outcomes over time, which should be considered by intervention programs. \textcopyright{} 2020, Fundacion VECA.

Aggression or hate speech that takes place through short message service (SMS) or the Internet (e.g., in social media platforms) is known as cyberbullying. Therefore, automatic detection utilizing natural language processing (NLP) is a necessary first step that helps prevent cyberbullying. This research proposes an automatic cyberbullying method to detect aggressive behavior using a consolidated deep learning model. This technique utilizes multichannel deep learning based on three models, namely, the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), transformer block, and convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify Twitter comments into two categories: aggressive and not aggressive. Three well-known hate speech datasets were combined to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method achieved promising results. The accuracy of the proposed method was approximately 88\%. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.}

In this paper, we introduce and release a new dataset for threatening language detection in Urdu tweets to further research in this language. The proposed dataset contains 3,564 tweets manually annotated by human experts as either threatening or non-threatening. The threatening tweets are further classified by the target into one of two types: threatening to an individual person or threatening to a group. This research follows a two-step approach: (i) classify a given tweet as threatening or non-threatening and (ii) classify whether a threatening tweet is used to threaten an individual or a group. We compare three forms of text representation: two count-based, where the text is represented using either character n -gram counts or word n -gram counts as feature vectors and the third text representation is based on fastText pre-trained word embeddings for Urdu. We perform several experiments using machine learning and deep learning classifiers and our study shows that an MLP classifier with the combination of word n -gram features outperformed other classifiers in detecting threatening tweets. Further, an SVM classifier using fastText pre-trained word embedding obtained the best results for the target identification task. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.}

Both types of empathy were negatively associated with cyberbullying as expected, with affective empathy having a stronger association with cyberbullying. We also investigated the mediating and moderating role of normative beliefs about aggression in two pathways\textemdash the relationship between affective empathy and cyberbullying and the relationship between cognitive empathy and cyberbullying. Findings suggested that normative beliefs about aggression was a partial mediator and moderator in the affective empathy-beliefs-cyberbullying pathway but normative beliefs about aggression was neither a mediator nor moderator in the cognitive empathy-beliefs-cyberbullying pathway. Normative beliefs about aggression served as the mechanism partially accounting for the relationship between affective empathy and cyberbullying. Furthermore, the relation between affective empathy and cyberbullying was found to be stronger for those with higher levels of normative beliefs of aggression. Collectively, together with other studies, this research contributes to an increasing number of studies demonstrating a stronger association between low empathy (in particular, low affective empathy) and bullying, whether traditional bullying or cyberbullying in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2016, \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2016.}

The objective of this study is to determine the association between WCB and the interpersonal deviance (ID) of victims through parallel mediation through the ineffectual silence of employees and emotional exhaustion (EE). Conservation of resource (COR) theory and affective events theory were used as the study's guiding framework, and data were drawn from 351 white-collar employees who were employed in a variety of industries - such as banking, telecommunications sector, education, health care, insurance, and consultancy - in Lahore, Pakistan. The results show that ineffectual silence negatively mediated the relationship between cyberbullying and deviance, decreasing the level of deviance of employees who used silence as a coping mechanism. EE, however, positively mediated the relationship between cyberbullying and deviance. This means that when employees felt emotionally overwhelmed they retaliated by engaging in deviant behaviors and acting as a bully toward colleagues. Drawing on the COR theory and the affective events theory, the findings show that WCB has an impact on ID. From a practical standpoint, the study reveals that WCB can lead to ID and it also may associate with large financial costs and workplace disruptions. Thus, organizations should establish a culture that prevent employees from engaging in WCB and adopt practices of prevention and intervention because it is not only harmful to the employees but also to the organization. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}

Method: A total of 425 high school students (199 boys and 226 girls) were selected using a cluster randomized procedure. The risk and protective factors included gender, internet use, self-esteem, dark triad traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy), school bullying perpetration, school bullying victimization, interparental conflict, and school climate. Results: The results of multinomial logistic regression showed that being male, school bullying perpetration, and school bullying victimization can significantly increase the chances of being a cyberbully-victim and spending one hour or less on the internet can significantly decrease the chances of being a cyberbully-victim. Conclusion: This study provides important implications for any prevention and intervention programs for cyberbullying, which must consider the roles of traditional bullying, gender differences, and internet use in cyberbullying behavior.

The model aims to recognize bullying patterns among Twitter communities, based on relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. Random Forest, a well-known machine-learning algorithm was used for cyberbullying classification (i.e. aggressor, spammer, bully and normal), applied in conjunction with a baseline algorithm encompassing seven Twitter features (i.e. number of mentions, number of followers and following, popularity, favorite count, status count and number of hash tags). Findings indicate that factoring user's personality greatly improves cyberbullying detection mechanisms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Big Five), and psychopathy (Dark Triad) were found to be significant in detecting bullies, achieving up to 96\% (precision) and 95\% (recall). The emergence of significant personality traits in an experimental study supports existing empirical studies that show the relationships between personality traits and cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

This study deals with automatic cyberbullying detection mechanism tapping into Twitter users' psychological features including personalities, sentiment and emotion. User personalities were determined using Big Five and Dark Triad models, whereas machine learning classifiers namely, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest and J48 were used to classify the tweets into one of four categories: bully, aggressor, spammer and normal. The Twitter dataset contained 5453 tweets gathered using the hashtag \#Gamergate, and manually annotated by human experts. Selected Twitter-based features namely text, user and network-based features were used as the baseline algorithm. Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2020}

Results indicated that men had higher scores on measures assessing dark personality traits and women had higher PSU. Narcissism and spitefulness were directly associated with PSU in the total sample, men, and women. Machiavellianism was indirectly associated with PSU via fearful attachment among men and sadism was directly and indirectly associated with PSU via fearful attachment among women. Findings suggest that dark personality traits may play a contributory role in higher PSU (with different traits having different effects among men and women), and that attachment styles partially explain the relationship between dark traits and PSU. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

This review expands on these issues and emphasizes the Barlett Gentile Cyberbullying Model (BGCM) as the only validated cyberbullying-specific theory to predict cyberbullying perpetration. Our principal thesis is that the wealth of research validating the BGCM has been with adult samples and applying the BGCM to adolescents presents both challenging and exciting research opportunities for future research and intervention development in youth. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Barlett, Bennardi, Williams and Zlupko.}

  abstract = {Objective: This study investigated the relations of adolescent and parent reports of adolescents' aggression and victimization on social media with self-perception (e.g., self-esteem, narcissism) and psychosocial adjustment (e.g., attention problems, conduct problems, anxiety, depression). Method: The sample consisted of 428 participants (214 parent\textendash adolescent dyads) from the United States, with adolescents ranging from 14 to 17 years of age. Results: The majority of adolescents and parents reported that the adolescents had not engaged in social media aggression or experienced victimization; however, nearly one-third of parents reported that they were ``unsure.'' Those involved in such online interactions tended to demonstrate a variety of psychosocial difficulties. Specifically, parent- and adolescent-reported aggression were associated with parent-reported inattention, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as adolescent-reported narcissism, loneliness, fear of missing out (FoMO), and lower self-esteem. Adolescent-reported victimization was associated with many parent-reported indicators of adjustment as well as adolescent-reported loneliness, FoMO, and lower self-esteem. Conclusions: Social media aggression and victimization were related to a variety of indicators of adolescent self-perception and adjustment. Importantly, adolescents who reported experiencing social media aggression and victimization tended to be viewed by their parents as more maladjusted. Implications for further research on the developmental trajectories of these relations are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

We critically explore the detection approaches to identify the unsolved problems in the domain. We scrutinized 147 articles to come out with the following findings: the targeted malicious accounts category, the list of features selected for the detection task, the social platform which offered features information, the application area that requires detection of malicious accounts, a comparison between detection methods, a comparison between available datasets, and the performance metrics used for validation. We also discuss the forthcoming challenges in terms of detection methods, annotation techniques, and validation protocols. \textcopyright{} 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

  abstract = {Purpose: With the rise of social media platforms, an increasing number of cases of cyberbullying has reemerged. Every day, large number of people, especially teenagers, become the victim of cyber abuse. A cyberbullied person can have a long-lasting impact on his mind. Due to it, the victim may develop social anxiety, engage in self-harm, go into depression or in the extreme cases, it may lead to suicide. This paper aims to evaluate various techniques to automatically detect cyberbullying from tweets by using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied machine learning algorithms approach and after analyzing the experimental results, the authors postulated that deep learning algorithms perform better for the task. Word-embedding techniques were used for word representation for our model training. Pre-trained embedding GloVe was used to generate word embedding. Different versions of GloVe were used and their performance was compared. Bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) was used for classification. Findings: The dataset contains 35,787 labeled tweets. The GloVe840 word embedding technique along with BLSTM provided the best results on the dataset with an accuracy, precision and F1 measure of 92.60\%, 96.60\% and 94.20\%, respectively. Research limitations/implications: If a word is not present in pre-trained embedding (GloVe), it may be given a random vector representation that may not correspond to the actual meaning of the word. It means that if a word is out of vocabulary (OOV) then it may not be represented suitably which can affect the detection of cyberbullying tweets. The problem may be rectified through the use of character level embedding of words. Practical implications: The findings of the work may inspire entrepreneurs to leverage the proposed approach to build deployable systems to detect cyberbullying in different contexts such as workplace, school, etc and may also draw the attention of lawmakers and policymakers to create systemic tools to tackle the ills of cyberbullying. Social implications: Cyberbullying, if effectively detected may save the victims from various psychological problems which, in turn, may lead society to a healthier and more productive life. Originality/value: The proposed method produced results that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in detecting cyberbullying from tweets. It uses a large dataset, created by intelligently merging two publicly available datasets. Further, a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methodology has been presented. \textcopyright{} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

Here, we replicated and extended that finding in two independent samples (study 1, n = 177; Study 2, n = 134) by showing large mate value discrepancies positively predict digital dating abuse, therefore suggesting that digital dating abuse could be a contemporary cost-inflicting mate retention strategy. We also explored whether intrasexual competition, self-esteem, and experience of previous infidelity predicted the perpetration of digital dating abuse, finding no significant relationships. These findings from two studies, replicate, extend, and provide further support that digital dating abuse is a mate retention tactic.

However, a current form of intimate partner violence is digital dating abuse, which involves abuse toward a romantic partner, occuring online through the use of electronic communication technology. This form of abuse differs from offline abuse, in that physical proximity is not required. Although research has focused on the effects digital dating abuse has on victims, little research has focused on the perpetration of digital dating abuse. This is important as research focused on perpetration can inform a wide range of initiatives geared toward understanding the factors which drive this behavior. Recent research has focused on evolutionary mating-relevant factors that drive the perpetration of digital dating abuse. Here, we extended and replicated previous work by reporting two studies (study 1, n = 114; study 2, n = 162) which explored the roles of mate value discrepancy, intrasexual competition, and relationship-contingent self-esteem in the perpetration of digital dating abuse. We found that mate value discrepancy (studies 1 and 2) and intrasexual competition (study 2) positively predicted the perpetration of digital dating abuse. To our knowledge, this article is the first to provide support that those who report high intrasexual competition, engage in greater levels of digital dating abuse, thus furthering theoretical advancements in this field by showing digital dating abuse is a mate retention tactic. Our findings further our understanding of online behavior in romantic relationships through an evolutionary psychological lens. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.}

Results showed that students reported more offline and online bullying if they had higher initial levels of individual moral disengagement and if they belonged to classrooms with higher initial levels of classroom collective moral disengagement. Also, a change in individual moral disengagement was positively associated with a change in bullying others offline and online. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

These posts were subjected to morphological, lexical and semantic analyses. More than 25\% of the sample reported engaging in harmful online behaviors. Males were more likely to send insulting or threatening messages and post aggressive comments; no gender differences were found for disseminating other people's private information. Psychopathy and male gender were the unique predictors of engagement in harmful online behaviors.

In Austria, after a lockdown was decreed on 16 March 2020, educational institutions had to switch to a patched-up distance learning approach, which has been largely maintained to date. This article delivers empirical insights from an interdisciplinary mixed-methods research study that investigated university students' perceptions of and experiences with distance learning as well as their educational (home) spaces during the pandemic in Innsbruck, Austria. It combines results from a quantitative survey conducted with 2742 students in early 2021 with a qualitative multi-method and longitudinal research study that accompanied 98 students throughout four data-collection phases in 2020. Results show a significant improvement since spring 2020 with both teachers and learners adjusting to the distance learning formats and the use of digital tools, yet students urgently desired a return to face-to-face teaching and university life, particularly for its social benefits. Strikingly, more than half of the participants wanted to maintain the option of overall distance education after the pandemic. Based on the perspectives of students, it is appropriate to demand significant changes in post-pan-demic education adapted to the era of the post-digital, for which this article gives short-term as well as medium-term recommendations. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

No other predictor reached significance, and gender (control variable) was also a non-significant predictor. Results are discussed through the lens of evolutionary theory and the General Aggression Model and indicate that the perpetration of Cyber Dating Abuse may be better attributed to reactive, emotional aggression, compared to proactive, instrumental aggression.

In other words, this research makes original contribution by exploring the predictive ability of the dark tetrad traits in individuals of different ethnicities and their subsequent willingness to engage in cyberbullying. The study (n = 1,464) explores whether there is a positive association between the dark tetrad personality traits and cyberbullying. The results reveal that all four traits predict cyberbullying in participants from across three different ethnicities (Asian, black, and white). Furthermore, female participants score less than their male counterparts across all four traits.

Outspokenness neither directly nor indirectly predicted trolling. Results also showed that Reddit users motivated by schadenfreude and users who exhibit trolling behaviors view trolling as not being a dysfunctional or undesirable response to online discourse. In addition, those with schadenfreude considered the practice of trolling to be functional/comprehensible.

Method: Online respondents (community adults and university students; total N = 1,715) completed self-report measures of personality and trolling behavior. They subsequently engaged in one of two judgment tasks. In Study 1, respondents viewed stimuli depicting scenes of emotional/physical suffering and provided ratings of (a) perceived pain intensity and (b) pleasure experienced while viewing the photos. In Study 2, the iTroll questionnaire was developed and validated. It was then administered alongside a moral judgment task. Results: Across both studies, online trolling was strongly associated with a sadistic personality profile. Moreover, sadism and trolling predicted identical patterns of pleasure and harm minimization. The incremental contribution of sadism was sustained even when controlling for broader antisocial tendencies (i.e., the Dark Triad, callous-unemotionality, and trait aggression). Conclusions: Results confirm that online trolling is motivated (at least in part) by sadistic tendencies. Coupled with effective rationalization mechanisms, sadistic pleasure can be consummated in such everyday behaviors as online trolling. \textcopyright{} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

In the present study, information was obtained on 5113 network contacts from 52 UK-based Facebook users (age range 13\textendash 45; 75\% female) using digitally derived data and in-depth network surveys. Participants rated their contacts in terms of online disagreement, relational closeness and interaction patterns. Characteristics of online troublemakers were explored using binary logistic multilevel analysis. Instances of online disagreement were most apparent in the networks of emerging adults (19\textendash 21 years). Contacts were more likely to be identified as online troublemakers if they were well connected within the network. Rates of offline and Facebook exchanges interacted such that contacts known well offline but with low rates of Facebook communication were more likely to be identified as troublemakers. This may indicate that users were harbouring known troublemakers in a bid to preserve offline relationships and reputational status. Implications are discussed in terms of an individual's susceptibility to undesirable encounters online. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

DSAR also predicted greater sadistic affect/motivation and greater self-elevation/victim derogation among prank viewers when the prospect of significant long-term harm befalling prank victims was salient, but not when harm was minimized (Study 2). Fueled by displaced hostility, enjoyment of others' experienced harm in pranking contexts indeed appears sadistic. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.}

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School rampage shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, we wrote a report for the National Science Foundation on what is known and not known about youth violence. This article summarizes and updates that report. After distinguishing violent behavior from aggressive behavior, we describe the prevalence of gun violence in the United States and age-related risks for violence. We delineate important differences between violence in the context of rare rampage school shootings, and much more common urban street violence. Acts of violence are influenced by multiple factors, often acting together. We summarize evidence on some major risk factors and protective factors for youth violence, highlighting individual and contextual factors, which often interact. We consider new quantitative "data mining" procedures that can be used to predict youth violence perpetrated by groups and individuals, recognizing critical issues of privacy and ethical concerns that arise in the prediction of violence. We also discuss implications of the current evidence for reducing youth violence, and we offer suggestions for future research. We conclude by arguing that the prevention of youth violence should be a national priority. \textcopyright{} 2016 American Psychological Association.}

In the current study, we aimed to provide a unique and comprehensive test of the pathway model of PSU. This model posits three distinct developmental pathways leading to PSU: (1) the excessive reassurance pathway, (2) the impulsive pathway and (3) the extraversion pathway. Methods: Undergraduate students (n 5 795, 69.8\% female, mean age 5 23.80 years, sd 5 3.02) completed online self-report measures of PSU (addictive use, antisocial use and dangerous use) and the psychological features (personality traits and psychopathological symptoms) underlying the three pathways. Results: Bayesian analyses revealed that addictive use is mainly driven by the excessive reassurance pathway and the impulsive pathway, for which candidate etiopathological factors include heightened negative urgency, a hyperactive behavioural inhibition system and symptoms of social anxiety. Dangerous and antisocial use are mainly driven by the impulsive pathway and the extraversion pathway, for which candidate etiopathological factors include specific impulsivity components (lack of premeditation and sensation seeking) and primary psychopathy (inclination to lie, lack of remorse, callousness and manipulativeness). Discussion and conclusions: The present study constitutes the first comprehensive test of the pathway model of PSU. We provide robust and original results regarding the psychological dimensions associated with each of the postulated pathways of PSU, which should be taken into account when considering regulation of smartphone use or tailoring prevention protocols to reduce problematic usage patterns. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s)}

While numerous meta-analyses have been conducted to synthesize empirical evidence on the association between narcissism and typical online behaviors (e.g., uploading photos and usage frequency), evidence on the association between narcissism and Problematic Social Media Use (PSMU) has not yet been systematized. The current study represents the first systematic review on this topic. Methods: Electronic literature databases, including the Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and EMBASE, were searched to identify studies that examined the relationship between narcissism and PSMU. We found 14 empirical studies on narcissism and PSMU. Additionally, seven studies focused on the association with Problematic Facebook Use (PFU). Results: Consistent results were reported regarding the positive and significant association between grandiose narcissism and PFU (0.13 {$<$} r {$<$} 0.32). The only two studies that included a vulnerable narcissism measure reported a positive and significant correlation with PFU as well. Studies that did not distinguish between different online platforms (i.e., those measuring PSMU) reported less consistent results. Conclusions: The results generally revealed that narcissism might be involved in PFU, but it might not have consistent effects across social media platforms. The assessment of problematic social media use without distinguishing different platforms might not individuate narcissists' preferences and risks. However, our findings need to be interpreted with caution not only due to the relatively small number of studies on this topic but also because 19 studies out 21 used a cross-sectional design. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors}

Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the empirical research of the psychosocial content published in the last five years (2016\textendash 2020) on dating apps. A search was conducted in different databases, and we identified 502 articles in our initial search. After screening titles and abstracts and examining articles in detail, 70 studies were included in the review. The most relevant data (author/s and year, sample size and characteristics, methodology) and their findings were extracted from each study and grouped into four blocks: user dating apps characteristics, usage characteristics, motives for use, and benefits and risks of use. The limitations of the literature consulted are discussed, as well as the practical implications of the results obtained, highlighting the relevance of dating apps, which have become a tool widely used by millions of people around the world. \textcopyright{} 2020 by the authors.

In the study, a mixed research design, which nests qualitative data into quantitative, was used. In addition to the scales and sociodemographic form, the Draw-a-Person test was also used to better understand children's inner world. According to the findings, there is a significant relationship between gaming disorder and narcissism and happiness levels in children. Accordingly, as narcissism increases in children, the gaming disorder level increases, and happiness decreases. We also found a mediation effect in the impact of narcissism on happiness through gaming disorder. According to the results, we think that the problem is not caused by the individual but by society. For a solution, we recommend making more macro-level social work interventions within the framework of system theory instead of the current medical model in combating gaming disorder. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

To address the research gaps identified in the literature, we draw on crime opportunity theory and the affordance perspective to propose a meta-framework that guides our investigation into SNS bullying. The meta-framework explains how SNS affordances give rise to the evaluation of favorable SNS environmental conditions for SNS bullying, which, in turn, promote SNS bullying. The research model was empirically tested using a longitudinal online survey of 223 SNS users. The results suggest that the evaluation of SNS environmental conditions predict SNS bullying, and SNS affordances influence the evaluation of these environmental conditions. This work offers a new theoretical perspective to study SNS bullying, highlighting the critical impacts of environmental conditions in shaping such behavior. It also provides actionable insights into measures that combat SNS bullying. \textcopyright, Copyright \textcopyright{} Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.}

In this paper, we develop a deep learning classifier that jointly models textual and visual characteristics of pro-eating disorder content that violates community guidelines. Using a million Tumblr photo posts, our classifier discovers deviant content efficiently while also maintaining high recall (85\%).

Participants were 2869 elementary school students (56.2\% boys), initially in fourth grade (Mage = 10.51 years) in China. Longitudinal data on peer aggression were collected from participants semiannually for 2 years. Data on victimization experiences were collected in the initial measurement wave. Parallel process latent curve growth modeling produced four co-developmental trajectories of peer aggression: High Desisting group, Moderate-Increasing group, Moderate-Physical and Relational Aggression group, and Low Stable group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that childhood emotional abuse, psychological maltreatment by teachers, as well as physical peer victimization, and cyber peer victimization, served as risk factors for severe co-developmental trajectories. The findings highlight the co-development of physical, relational, and cyber aggression. The identification of risk factors for co-developmental trajectories points to the need for continued monitoring and protection from ongoing victimization experiences in the family and school settings to prevent or ameliorate aggressive behavior. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.}

This study sought to address the debate by formulating a new, nuanced framework highlighting two conceptual distinctions: (a) preference for versus problem in one's interpersonal relations, and (b) SNS use versus the benefits of such use. Mixed-effects meta-analysis was performed in 178 independent samples from seven regions worldwide (n = 108,068; age range = 13-68). Eligible studies were those that examined an association between at least one common proxy measure of the socially rich (vs. poor; i.e., extraversion, social anxiety, or loneliness) and a criterion measure (i.e., SNS use or online social capital). The results revealed a complex picture. SNS use was positively correlated with both extraversion and social anxiety, although the social anxiety-SNS use correlation was significant for adult samples rather than adolescent samples. Online social capital was positively correlated with extraversion but inversely correlated with loneliness. Our conclusion is that extraverted individuals use SNS to enhance their opportunities for social interactions and can acquire more online social resources, whereas adults who are socially anxious use SNS to compensate for their social deficits but such effort is unrelated to online social resource accumulation. Individuals who feel lonely tend to obtain few such resources. However, most of the studies examined the leisure use of Facebook. We advocate more thorough testing of our hypotheses in future research on therapeutic SNS use and/or the use of SNS other than Facebook. \textcopyright{} 2019 American Psychological Association.}

Most existing work towards cyberbullying detection has focused on the accuracy, and overlooked causes of the outcome. Discovering the causes of cyberbullying from observational data is challenging due to the existence of confounders, variables that can lead to spurious causal relationships between covariates and the outcome. This work studies the problem of robust cyberbullying detection with causal interpretation and proposes a principled framework to identify and block the influence of the plausible confounders, i.e., p-confounders. The de-confounded model is causally interpretable and is more robust to the changes in data distribution. We test our approach using the state-of-the-art evaluation method, causal transportability. The experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The purpose of this study is to provide a computational means to understanding cyberbullying behavior from observational data. This improves our ability to predict and to facilitate effective strategies or policies to proactively mitigate the impact of cyberbullying. \dbend{} 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.}

Recent years have witnessed a surge in research aimed at developing principled learning models to detect cyberbullying behaviors. These efforts have primarily focused on building a single generic classification model to differentiate bullying content from normal (non-bullying) content among all users. These models treat users equally and overlook idiosyncratic information about users that might facilitate the accurate detection of cyberbullying. In this paper, we propose a personalized cyberbullying detection framework, PI-Bully, that draws on empirical findings from psychology highlighting unique characteristics of victims and bullies and peer influence from like-minded users as predictors of cyberbullying behaviors. Our framework is novel in its ability to model peer influence in a collaborative environment and tailor cyberbullying prediction for each individual user. Extensive experimental evaluations on real-world datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. \textcopyright{} 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The theoretical model was tested using data collected from 1067 Chinese university students (Mage = 20.22 years, SD = 1.45). Participants completed anonymous questionnaires assessing their social support, Internet addiction, cyberbullying as well as stress level. Results indicated that Internet addiction partially mediated the association between social support and cyberbullying. Stress played a moderating role in the first stage. Specifically, the effect of social support on Internet addiction was significant only for university students under low stress. Results highlight the significance of identifying the mechanisms that moderate the mediated paths between social support and cyberbullying of young adults. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

This study examined the relationships among the Dark Tetrad personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, sadism), impulsivity, and social media addiction. One hundred and twenty-eight Malaysian university students completed the GoStop Impulsivity Paradigm task, a laboratory behavioural measure of impulsivity. Participants also completed the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, the Short Dark Triad, and the Assessment of Sadistic Personality. Data on participants' average daily time spent on social media and the number of applications they had were retrieved from their smartphones. Correlation analyses showed that average daily screen-time and psychopathy were positively associated with social media addiction. Regression analyses revealed that being a female, having spent more time on social media, and scoring higher on the psychopathy scale were related to greater levels of addiction. Apart from having a positive correlation with the number of social media applications users had, impulsivity was not associated with any of the variables of interest. This study highlights the importance of a multi-measurement approach to assessing the psycho-socio-demographic variables implicated in the initiation, development, and maintenance of addictive behaviours. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {Introduction: Tinder is the most popular and used meeting application for dating. However, its impact on sexual behavior and sexual health has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Objectives: To review the current empirical knowledge on the sexual health and sexual behavior effects related to Tinder use. Methods: A literature review was conducted based on empirical studies published in the last 5 years. A computerized search was performed to identify all relevant studies in PubMed and Google Scholar. The following search terms were used: ``Tinder'' AND ``Sexuality'' OR ``Tinder'' AND ``Sexual Behavior'' OR ``Tinder'' AND ``Sexual Dysfunctions'' OR ``Tinder'' AND ``Sexual Health.'' 34 articles fully satisfied the established criteria. Results: We found sociosexuality, that is, sexual activities outside a committed relationship, to be the main predictor for casual sex in the Tinder users. The sexual aims appeared gender-influenced: men used Tinder mostly for casual sex compared with women. With respect to other dating apps, it has been also found that the Tinder use is less related to the risk of sexually transmitted infections. However, specific personality traits related to dark personality (ie, the association of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) were more frequently reported among male Tinder users. Conclusion: Existing literature concerning Tinder use shows the advantages and disadvantages of this dating technology. Casual sex might be a risk for sexual health, but Tinder users have also been committed to romantic relationships. Moreover, some pathological aspects of personality characterize some Tinder users. From an evolutionary perspective, sociosexuality partially explains the reasons of the Tinder user's interest for casual sex. Finally, this review highlights the need of further studies on Tinder as a new, pivotal virtual place to promote sex education and sexual health. Ciocca G, Robilotta A, Fontanesi L, et al.

Participants who disseminated sexts (17.4\%) were more likely sexually active, and from a younger age, had requested sexts, received disseminated sexts, and reported higher dark triad trait levels. Images were usually received from a different gender and disseminated to the same gender. Men and women were equally likely to disseminate sexts, mainly to the same gender, whilst men tended to distribute to more individuals. Common motivations were attractiveness, humour and unimportance, with revenge uncommon. Men were more frequently motivated by attractiveness and increased social status. Four unique factors were associated with sext dissemination: having requested sexts, received disseminated sexts, had one's own sexts disseminated and elevated narcissistic traits; consistent with social exchange theory. Age, having requested sexts and having one's own images shared were associated with increased frequency of dissemination. One in ten respondents knew of their own sexts being disseminated; with men (27.9\%) three times more likely than women (9.5\%) to have consented to dissemination. Theoretical explanations and implications are discussed. Future interventions should focus on explicit consent and empathy, rather than punitive approaches. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {``Slutpages'' are a pernicious form of online image-based evaluative voyeurism (OIBEV), whereby (sexualized) images of women are posted on webpages for (predominantly) male groups to rate and comment. Despite media and public concern, OIBEV sites have garnered limited empirical study. This paper presents the first analysis of OIBEV site visitation motivations across United States and Australian samples. Participants comprised a convenience sample of 1148 young adults aged 18 to 29 years (M = 22.54, SD = 2.50); 53.0\% women, 47.0\% men; 54\% residing in the U.S. and 46\% in Australia. Respondents completed an online questionnaire. Overall, 23\% of United States and 16\% of Australian respondents had visited OIBEV sites. OIBEV site visitation was uniquely associated with gender and country (with men and United States being more likely to visit OIBEV sites), requesting and disseminating sexts and having one's own image shared. Cyberbullying perpetration was associated with reduced odds of OIBEV site visitation. Motivations differed by gender, with men (80\%) being most likely to visit sites to ``check them out'' while women were equally likely to check it out (41\%) or to see if they were depicted (36\%). For men, unique predictors of OIBEV site visitation were having requested, disseminated and received disseminated sexts, lower levels of anxiety and reduced likelihood of cyberbullying perpetration. For women, OIBEV site visitation was uniquely associated with being a United States resident, sext dissemination victimization, receipt of disseminated sexts, higher levels of anxiety but reduced stress. Our findings confirm that OIBEV sites represent a highly gendered form of online image-based sexual abuse, and may have important mental health implications, given the associations with increased anxiety. Our results support the need for ``slutpage'' education for adolescents and young adults to address social and peer norms that encourage and support non-consensual use of intimate images. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Clancy, Maas, March, Howard and Klettke.}

In this study, a three-class model best described adolescents' cyber aggression and victimization; in the sample of 400 adolescents ages 12\textendash 18, 79.4\% were uninvolved, 13.1\% were mixed cyber aggressor-victims (moderate proactive and reactive cyber aggression, and cyber victimization), and 7.4\% were highly reactive cyber aggressor-victims (moderate proactive cyber aggression and cyber victimization, but high reactive cyber aggression). These groups contrast with those found in empirical traditional aggression research as pure cyber aggressors and cyber victims were not identified. Consistent with evolutionary theory and aggression research that suggest it has adaptive functions, mixed cyber aggressor-victims reported more social dominance and dating partners, and highly reactive cyber aggressor-victims reported more sexual partners, when compared to uninvolved peers. However, highly reactive cyber aggressor-victims also reported more friendship anxiety and less implicit social power than the mixed and uninvolved group, consistent with traditional research suggesting that reactive aggression is more strongly linked to social disadvantages and less strongly linked to social advantages, than is proactive aggression. Although cyber aggression is a relatively new form of aggression, an evolutionary perspective can illuminate why it continues to be a social problem despite intervention efforts. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

Contrary to extant literature, our study of complete trolling interactions found striking similarities between teammates' and trolls' chats, with both displaying the negative traits (e.g., exclusionary language) typically attributed to trolls. Findings also suggest that the transition from victim to perpetrator can occur extremely rapidly. This has important implications for the labelling of actors in trolling interactions, for future studies into the trolling cycle, and for theories of computer-mediated communication. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2019.}

However, the present article aims to expand this framework and apply it to problematic gaming, also known as trolling. Although still a relatively new field, research into trolling has exploded within the past ten years. However, the vast majority of these studies are descriptive in nature. The present article marries theory and trolling research by closely examining interdisciplinary empirical evidence from a single platform\textemdash video games\textemdash and applying the various forms of demands to propose a testable, dual-route model of trolling behaviour. Within the video game context, I argue the presence of two primary causal mechanisms that can lead to trolling: 1) Demand imbalance between players and the game; and 2) demand imbalance between players. The article discusses how these two types of imbalance can lead to trolling, which kinds of demands can be imbalanced, and how future researchers can use the demand framework to expand our understanding of trolling. \textcopyright{} 2019, Cogitatio Press.

The present study analyses the perceptions of 4,273 students in secondary education in Aragon (Spain) on how the positive relationships that occur in the educational centre (among students and their classmates, teachers, school principals and other staff) and between the family and the school mediate the prevention of bullying and cyberbullying. The study was performed in 20 educational centres of the Autonomous Community of Aragon, considering the stratified representation of the provinces, private and public schools, and rural and urban areas. The study was conducted by applying questionnaires on bullying and cyberbullying, among other questions, and by evaluating the relationship between students and the rest of the educational community. An analysis was elaborated from a structural equation model (SEM), using as exogenous variables the student's assessment of relations with the rest of the members of the educational community and, as endogenous variables, victimization, aggression and perception of bullying situations and cyberbullying (bystanders). This study concluded by exposing aspects related to these protective factors, which are so important for the development of a positive coexistence and personal relationships. Our research brings advances towards a positive and transformative vision for preventing bullying and cyberbullying. From this proposal, we find interesting the importance and necessity to overcome the silence of cyber-victimized adolescents, reinforcing not only the peer network in the educational centre but also teacher and family networks. \textcopyright{} 2020, \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s).

Surprisingly, the precursors of maladaptive daydreaming and its role in excessive involvement in virtual worlds have been scarcely investigated. In the current study, we examined the relationships among attachment styles, maladaptive daydreaming, and problematic social media use (PSMU) in a sample of community-dwelling adults. Eight hundred seventy-seven participants between 18 and 68 years old were recruited via an online survey and asked to fill out self-reported measures on attachment styles, maladaptive daydreaming, and PSMU. Mediation analyses showed that maladaptive daydreaming is a significant mediator in the relationships between preoccupied and fearful attachment styles and PSMU, suggesting that maladaptive daydreaming partly explains the established link between insecure attachment styles and excessive use of social media. Individuals with PSMU fostered by maladaptive daydreaming may benefit from clinical interventions that promote the use of adaptive regulatory strategies to develop feelings of security and self-confidence that may serve to reduce the excessive involvement in social media. \textcopyright{} 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Negative consequences of SMU for adolescent health could include exposures to online forms of aggression. We explored age, gender, and cross-national differences in adolescents' engagement in SMU, then relationships between SMU and victimization and the perpetration of cyber-bullying. Methods: We used data on young people aged 11\textendash 15 years (weighted n = 180,919 in 42 countries) who participated in the 2017\textendash 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study to describe engagement in the three types of SMU (intense, problematic, and talking with strangers online) by age and gender and then in the perpetration and victimization of cyber-bullying. Relationships between SMU and cyber-bullying outcomes were estimated using Poisson regression (weighted n = 166,647 from 42 countries). Results: Variations in SMU and cyber-bullying follow developmental and gender-based patterns across countries. In pooled analyses, engagement in SMU related to cyber-bullying victimization (adjusted relative risks = 1.14 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10\textendash 1.19] to 1.48 [95\% CI: 1.42\textendash 1.55]) and perpetration (adjusted relative risk = 1.31 [95\% CI: 1.26\textendash 1.36] to 1.84 [95\% CI: 1.74\textendash 1.95]). These associations were stronger for cyber-perpetration versus cyber-victimization and for girls versus boys. Problematic SMU was most strongly and consistently associated with cyber-bullying, both for victimization and perpetration. Stratified analyses showed that SMU related to cyber-victimization in 19\%\textendash 45\% of countries and to cyber-perpetration in 38\%\textendash 86\% of countries. Conclusions: Accessibility to social media and its pervasive use has led to new opportunities for online aggression. The time adolescents spend on social media, engage in problematic use, and talk to strangers online each relate to cyber-bullying and merit public health intervention. Problematic use of social media poses the strongest and most consistent risk. \textcopyright{} 2020}

Results indicated that discordance about sexual behaviour, age, and partner objectification predicted who sexted first.

Although there are diverse types of sexting involving the exchange of different sexual content, two scenarios will be examined here: (a) the exchange of intimate images solely between two partners; and (b) sharing intimate images exchanged between partners with others outside the relationship. Objective: The aim of this study was to verify empathy-related differences between sexting within consensual relationships and non-consensual distribution of intimate images. Methods: This was a crosssectional study in which participants provided information through a self-reported questionnaire. Inventories for empathy and sexual impulsiveness and measures of sociodemographic features and sexting behaviors were applied. Results: This study included 202 medical students. The groups of students engaged in sexting (with or without sharing partners' intimate images) demonstrated higher sexual impulsiveness and lower personal distress than the reference group. Only the students who admitted to sharing partners' intimate images showed lower empathic concern and perspective taking than the reference group (affective and cognitive empathy, respectively). Overall, the results of this study support previous findings that individuals engaged in sexting demonstrate lower personal discomfort with their actions than people not engaged in sexting. Conclusion: Despite knowing the legal consequences of the exposure of intimate images from partners or colleagues, some students seem to prefer taking this risk. \textcopyright{} The authors (2020).}

Two exploratory factor analyses examined the experiences of self-identified victims and perpetrators in order to better describe and identify UOA. The findings identify six dimensions, namely, for the victims: harassment, impersonation, denigration and ordering goods, physical threats, hacking, and disseminating private information and audio-video material without permission; and, for the perpetrators: disseminating private information and material without permission, physical and social threats, hacking and stealing identity, harassment, denigration and ordering goods, unwanted emails and spying, and impersonation \textendash{} thus illuminating more specific categories of UOA.

  abstract = {Cyberbullying is an intentional aggressive behavior repeatedly perpetrated by a single person or a group against a peer who can not easily defend, characterized by the use of electronic forms of contact. This phenomenon is a public health concern with serious implications for adolescents' mental health. We aimed to investigate the role of gender, age, and subjective self perceived mood states in cyberbullying and victimization (being a victim of cyberbullying) behaviors. A total of 554 adolescents (293 males and 261 females, age 15.27; SD = 2.21) completed the Florence Cyber-Bullying Cyber-Victimization Scales (FCBVSs) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Older age and male gender were associated to both cyberbullying and victimization.The aggressiveness/anger (A) and confusion/bewilderment (C) factors measured by the POMS were predictors of all types of cyberbulliyng and cybervictimization behaviors; the tension/anxiety (T) factor was a predictor of all cyberbullying behaviors and of the FCBVSs impersonification subscale of cybervictimization. Subjective specific mood states may contribute to both cyberbulliyng and victimization behaviors, suggesting the potential benefit of preventive strategies addressing the recognition and management of mood states in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2021}

In the course of a theoretical analysis of the works of foreign researchers, mainly of the last five years, devoted to the problem of bullying on the Internet, data from numerous surveys on the prevalence of the phenomenon in various countries are presented, the interpretation of the concept of "cyberbullying" adopted in the scientific community is discussed, its classifications and types are considered, as well as the most popular theoretical models of this destructive phenomenon, the prerequisites and predictors, the roles of communication participants and the peculiarities of their interaction in a virtual environment are highlighted. A review of modern studies made it possible to draw attention to the methods of collecting information used abroad, as well as to the relationship with the characteristics of the "dark triad of personality" and the parameters of the "Big Five" test. Analyzing destructive behavior in cyberspace, scientists associate it with an excessive degree of self-disclosure on social networks and the publication of too explicit, provocative content, increased use of psychoactive substances, low levels of friendly support, negative family environment and sexual violence. It was shown that a high degree of peer friendly support, warm relationships at school, and parental support are a protective factor against virtual bullying. Cyberbullying victimization affects the psychosomatic status of the victim, causing increased anxiety, anger, depression, sleep problems, theft, harm, and violation of social rules. \textcopyright{} 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

When dealing with cyberstalking, institutions and governments struggle in how to manage it and where to allocate resources. Therefore, it is important to understand how individuals feel about the problem of cyberstalking and how it can be managed. In this paper, we use Nissenbaum's (Wash L Rev 79(1):119\textendash 158, 2004) contextual integrity as a theoretical framework for applying Keeney's (Manag Sci 45: 533\textendash 542, 1999) value-focused thinking technique to develop actionable objectives aimed at the prevention of cyberstalking. By systematically interviewing over 100 individuals, we extract 20 objectives based on the underlying norms of distribution and appropriateness relevant to the context of cyberstalking. The objectives ensure that contextual integrity is maintained and cyberstalking prevented. Organizations can benefit from the objectives developed in this research since they are a means for developing an ethical policy regarding cyberstalking. Therefore, they help to ensure an ethical engagement with society at large by organizations when dealing with cyberstalking. Researchers can use these objectives to explore the best means for their implementation by organizations and institutions. Additionally they can explore the network mapping of fundamental and means objectives to determine relationships and their strengths in the cyberstalking context. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

These behaviours are a matter of concern, as they are detrimental to people's well-being. The present study examines the empirical association among social media stalking, online self-disclosure, social media sleep hygiene, compulsive social media use and problematic sleep, most of which have been previously recognized as key dark side behaviours. While social media stalking is a relatively new and under-explored phenomenon, its predecessor, the much-castigated cyberstalking, has received sufficient scholarly attention. This study's hypothesized associations are grounded in cognitive-behavioural theory, self-awareness theory and problem behaviour theory, which we test using cross-sectional data from 876 social media users. We further control for age and gender. The findings suggest that stalking and online self-disclosure drive compulsive use and poor sleep hygiene, with stalking being the chief driver in both cases. Problematic sleep is influenced by stalking, compulsive use and poor sleep hygiene, with sleep hygiene having the strongest effect, while poor sleep hygiene and compulsive use also partially mediate the association of both stalking and online self-disclosure with problematic sleep. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

Vast research has been carried out on this topic around the world however there has not been enough research that is New Zealand based. The objective of this research is to identify the characteristics of cyber victims on social media in New Zealand. We scrutinize the prevalence of cyberbullying in New Zealand among university students based on age, gender and personality. The survey was designed stating the hypotheses developed as a result of the literature review. We gathered the data of sample size n = 158. We conclude that students with openness to experience are more likely to be cyberbullied compared to the other personalities. Whereas, we found no correlation of age and gender with the cyber bullying on a university level. The results from this study can have a positive application in counter cyberbullying programs in New Zealand. This study will a give an impetus for further analytical research in the field of cyber bullying in New Zealand. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}

The results show that participants who reported political opinion had significantly higher scores of schizoid, antisocial and narcissistic personality beliefs than those who did not. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict personality beliefs of purpose, sharing and profile information. When the t-test is examined, it is seen that commenting on only the shares of the subject variables is a significant predictor of the narcissistic personality belief. In this study, participants who have narcissistic, passive-aggressive, paranoid and antisocial personality beliefs usually and more frequently share songs on social networks. \textcopyright 2019.

The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of gender and the dark personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism in predicting perpetration of a range of antisocial behaviours on the popular dating app Tinder. It was hypothesised that the male gender and higher scores on these personality traits would predict perpetration of antisocial behaviours on Tinder. Participants (N = 587; 21\% men, 79\% women) completed an online questionnaire, including the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} Scale which was constructed to measure a range of antisocial behaviours. Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analyses revealed three forms of antisocial behaviours (General, esteem, and sexual) which explained over half of the variance (58.99\%) of variance in the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} measure. Regression analyses were run for each form of antisocial behaviour, and the predictive utility of gender and the dark traits were found to differ across the antisocial behaviours.

Nowadays, in network security, an intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an important role to detect intrusive activity. With the purpose of reducing the search dimensionality and enhancing classification performance of IDS model, in the literature several hybrid evolutionary algorithms have been investigated to tackle anomaly detection problems, but they have few drawbacks such as poor diversity, massive false negative rate, and stagnation.To resolve these limitations, in this study, we introduce a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm combining the techniques of grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and simulated annealing (SA), called GOSA for IDS that extracts the most noteworthy features and eliminates irrelevant ones from the original IDS datasets. In the proposed method, SA is integrated into GOA, while utilizing it to increase the solution quality after each iteration of GOA. Support vector machine is used as a fitness function in the proposed method to select relevant features which can help to classify attacks accurately. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two IDS datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. From experimental results, we observe that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and attains high detection rate as 99.86\%, an accuracy as 99.89\%, and low false alarm rate as 0.009 in NSL-KDD and high detection rate as 98.85\%, an accuracy as 98.96\%, and low false alarm rate as 0.084 in UNSW-NB15. \textcopyright{} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

The present study examined the relationship between impulsivity and helping behavior in bystanders of cyberbullying. To predict the likelihood of helping a victim when witnessing cyberbullying, we collected self-reported data from a representative sample of 2309 pupils, aged 9 to 17. The results suggested that more impulsive adolescents were less likely to help the cybervictim. An explanation for the findings may be that helping behavior in a cyberbullying context requires inhibitory abilities which are deficit in impulsive adolescents. These findings could be used to inform intervention strategies about which factors are associated with bystander behavior in cyberbullying and how to target these. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Inc.}

Motivated by the documented success of neural networks, we propose a complete model combining the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) and the self-attention mechanism.

The present study sought to address this research gap by examining whether these sex differences might be explained by narcissism and relational self-construal (i.e., the extent to which an individual defines their self in terms of close relationships). To this end, 573 participants living in the United States completed measures of narcissism, relational self-construal, and motives for using Facebook. Results revealed that men reported more antisocial motives for using Facebook than did women, which was explained by their greater narcissism. Conversely, women reported stronger prosocial motives for using Facebook, which was explained by their more relational self-construal.

In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation (Study 1; n = 290, 42\% female) and linear mixed effects (Study 2; n = 364, 51\% female) analyses to investigate whether judgements of deepfaking (measured across 12 self-report items) differed as a function of victim status (celebrity, non-celebrity), victim and participant demographics, and image use (sharing, own sexual gratification), whilst controlling for the potential covariates of psychopathy and beliefs about a just world. We consistently observed more lenient judgements of deepfake generation and dissemination for victims who were celebrities and male, and when images were created for self-sexual gratification rather than being shared. Moreover, lenient judgements, as well as proclivity to act were predicted by greater levels of psychopathy. We discuss our findings in the context of future research needing to better understand the general public's rationale for said disparity in judgements, as well as identifying and combating barriers to disclose victimisation.

  abstract = {Various techniques based on artificial intelligence have been proposed for the automatic detection of online anti-social behaviors, both in existing systems and in the scientific literature. In this article, we describe TrollPacifier, a holistic system for troll detection, which analyses many different features of trolls and legitimate users on the popular Twitter platform. In this system, the most known and promising approaches and research lines are applied, along with original new ideas, in a form that fits such a large public platform. In particular, we have identified six groups of features, based respectively on the analysis of writing style, sentiment, behaviors, social interactions, linked media, and publication time. As its main scientific contributions, this work provides: (i) an up-to-date analysis of the state of the art for the problem of troll detection; (ii) the systematic collection and grouping of features, on Twitter; (iii) the description of a working holistic system for troll detection, with a very high accuracy (95.5\%); and (iv) a comparison among the different features, with a machine learning approach. Our results demonstrate that automatic classification can be useful in the whole process of identification and management of online anti-social behaviors. However, a multi-faceted approach is required, in order to obtain an adequate accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd}

In this narrative literature review, I provide an overview of the sadism research to date, appraising critical issues in the current literature and highlighting future research directions. I start with the issues surrounding the definition and measurement of sadism: there is debate regarding exactly what sadism is, which has led to a number of limitations with existing measures. I then discuss the relationship between sadism and antisocial behaviour: sadism is clearly associated with cruel behaviour towards others, but its exact role in such behaviour, and the precise distinction between sadistic and non-sadistic crimes, has proved hard to characterise. I consider sadism in the context of other antagonistic personality traits \textendash{} psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism \textendash{} and throughout the review I also discuss sexual sadism, a related construct characterised by sexual arousal to others' suffering. Finally, I consider future research directions: clear definitions and measurement tools, the development of sadism in childhood and adolescence, and the evaluation of possible treatments. Sadism often motivates antisocial behaviour, which takes a significant toll on its victims; understanding exactly what sadism is, and whether it can be treated, is of vital importance. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

On social media, selfies serve as a self-presentation of one's appearance to an online audience. In this 2 \texttimes{} 2 experiment, women (N = 120, Mage = 19.87) took pictures of themselves (i.e., selfies) or objects. They were told beforehand that these pictures would be kept private or that they would be posted online on social media. After taking pictures, we assessed women's self-objectification, mood, and self-esteem. Women then engaged in a photo tagging task in which they selected hashtags for selfies of other women. Selfie takers expressed higher self-objectification, more negative mood, and diminished self-esteem compared to those taking pictures of objects. Selfie takers also demonstrated comparatively less social aggression, using fewer derogatory tags on other women's pictures. Although taking selfies may negatively affect producers, there may be benefits for online social interaction with peers. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {The introduction of technological innovations is often associated with suboptimal decisions and actions during cycles of inflated expectations, disappointment, and unintended negative consequences. For brevity, these can be referred to as hype cycles. Hitherto, studies have reported hype cycles for many different technologies, and studies have proposed different methods for improving the introduction of technological innovations. Yet hype cycles persist, despite suboptimal outcomes being widely reported and despite methods being available to improve outcomes. In this communication paper, findings from exploratory research are reported, which introduce new directions for addressing hype cycles. Through reference to neuroscience studies, it is explained that the behavior of some adults in hype cycles can be analogous to that of irresponsible behavior among adolescents. In particular, there is heightened responsiveness to peer presence and potential rewards. Accordingly, it is argued that methods applied successfully to reduce irresponsible behavior among adolescents are relevant to addressing hype cycles, and to facilitating more responsible research and innovation. The unsustainability of hype cycles is considered in relation to hype about artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, the potential for human-beneficial AI to have the unintended negative consequence of being fatally unbeneficial to everything else in the geosphere other than human beings. \textcopyright{} 2018 by the authors.}

People use various techniques to find information about others, capitalizing on online affordances by using search engines to find relevant websites and databases; scouring the target's social media or social networking site presence; accessing information about the target via their links or network association with others on social media; or asking questions or crowdsourcing information through online channels. Researchers have coined an assortment of terms to describe online social information seeking behaviors, such as interpersonal electronic surveillance, social surveillance, monitoring, patient-targeted Googling, cybervetting, websleuthing, human flesh search, lateral surveillance, Facebook surveillance, and Facebook stalking. Although considerable research has examined these behaviors, there has been little effort to clarify the concepts themselves. As a result, the literature is currently full of inconsistent and overlapping conceptualizations. To synthesize these concepts for future research, this review examines 73 online social information seeking concepts extracted from 186 articles. Specifically, the concepts are reviewed in light of their scope; the information seeker or target of information seeking (e.g., romantic partners, parents, children, employees, criminals); motives for information seeking (e.g., uncertainty, threat, curiosity); and the intensity of the behavior. Recommendations are provided for future research, such as employing clear conceptualizations and incorporating affordances. Finally, we offer a decision tree that researchers can use to help select appropriate terms to use in their work moving forward. \textcopyright{} 2021, Review of Communication Research.

At the same time, the last decades have demonstrated that online discourses are often characterised by so-called `dark participation' the spreading of lies and incivility. Using `problematic behaviour theory' as framework and focusing on incivility as a specific form of dark participation, this article investigates the role of users' personal characteristics, media use, and online experiences in relation to offensive and hateful online behaviour. Using a random-quota survey of the German population, we explored how dark personality traits, political attitudes and emotions, the frequency and spaces of online-media use, and users' experiences with both civil and uncivil online discourses predicted participants own uncivil behaviour, such as posting, sharing, or liking uncivil content. We found that 46\% of the participants who had witnessed incivility in the last three months also engaged in uncivil participation. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that incivility was associated with manipulative personality traits as measured by the dark triad, right-wing populist voting intentions, and frequent social-media use. Experiences with both civil comments and hate speech predicted higher levels of uncivil participation. The strongest predictor was participants' personal experiences with online victimisation. Overall, the results confirmed that dark participation in the sense of uncivil engagement results from the interplay of personality traits, an online environment that allows for deviant engagement, and, most importantly, participants' experiences in said environment. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).}

The main objectives are, first, to look for similarities and to explain dissimilarities and, second, to gain some much-needed insight into how moral life is structured in social virtual communities and how important the role of gossip is. Results show overlaps between online and offline gossip concerning uses and functions. Gossip is important as a means for reputation management; as a cultural learning system; as a sanctioning system; and as entertainment. Just as in traditional offline communities, gossip is a central mechanism to regulate virtual moral life that stretches out to blogs, websites, and face-to-face meetings. Yet, technology amplifies the effects by creating new possibilities such as logging the evidence in order to spot cheaters. This way, in-world gossip becomes an inflated form of traditional gossip. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.}

An underlying factor structure was identified with subgroups of negative outcomes identified relating to hacking/identity theft, abuse/harassment, non-targeted scams and targeted scams. Victimisation was associated with engagement with online pornography and forums; use of multiple discussion forums, dating, and gaming sites; and expenditure on gaming, dating and pornography sites.

Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, the current research examined how individual and organisational factors were related to WB and CB at two time points three months apart. Methods: Data were collected by means of an online self-report survey. Eight hundred and twenty-six respondents (58\% female, 42\% male) provided data at both time points. Results: One hundred and twenty-three (15\%) of participants had been bullied and 23 (2.8\%) of participants had been cyber-bullied within the last six months. Women reported more WB, but not more CB, than men. Worse physical health, higher strain, more destructive leadership, more team conflict and less effective organisational strategies were associated with more WB. Managerial employees experienced more CB than non-managerial employees. Poor physical health, less organisational support and less effective organisational strategies were associated with more CB. Conclusion: Rates of CB were lower than those of WB, and very few participants reported experiencing CB without also experiencing WB. Both forms of bullying were associated with poorer work environments, indicating that, where bullying is occurring, the focus should be on organisational systems and processes. \textcopyright{} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.}

To further explore this influencing mechanism, materialism was examined as a mediator, and parental psychological control (PPC) was examined as a moderator in the relationship between HH and CP. A total of 1,004 Chinese adolescents (M = 12.95, SD =1.12) participated in this study using a cross-sectional design and multiple questionnaires, namely, the Honesty-Humility subscale of the 24-item Brief HEXACO Inventory, the Revised Cyber Bullying Inventory, the Material Values Scale for Children, and the Parental Control Questionnaire. Correlation analyses indicated that CP, materialism, and PPC were significantly and positively correlated with each other, and were significantly and negatively associated with HH. The mediation model revealed that materialism played a mediating role in the relationship between HH and CP. The moderated mediation model revealed that stronger PPC strengthened the direct associations of HH with materialism and CP, and further strengthened the indirect relationship between HH and CP. Specifically, Chinese adolescents with lower levels of HH were more likely to build material values and further engaged in cyberbullying perpetration, when they perceived stronger PPC. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.}

Risk factors were measured in line with previous theoretical models, including biological or personality-related variables (e.g., low self-control, dark-side personality traits, empathy) and environmental variables (e.g., perceived social support, lack of rule clarity, and internet use). Additionally, we examined several possible outcomes of CV and CP. Results from path analyses revealed that involvement with traditional bullying (either as a perpetrator or a victim) as well as Machiavellianism significantly predicted CV and CP. With regard to the cross-lagged associations between CV and CP, we found that Time 1 CV predicted time 2 CP, but Time 1 CP did not predict Time 2 CV. That is, being a victim of cyberbullying during the Fall semester predicted involvement as a perpetrator in the Spring semester. However, being a perpetrator during the Fall semester did not predict being a victim during the Spring semester. Regarding outcomes, we found that CV significantly predicted anxiety, depression, and helping behavior, and CP significantly predicted deviant behavior, but not GPA nor alcohol consumption. These findings have practical implications for college students as well as university student support services. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC}

College students (N = 227) completed a questionnaire and reported on their trait Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism, and the degree to which they cyberbullied (i.e., both visual and text based bullying) others in the past year. Correlations revealed that all three Dark Triad traits were related positively with cyberbullying. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three Dark Triad traits, psychopathy emerged as the unique predictor of cyberbullying. These findings reinforce extant research suggesting that personality traits are important predictors of computer-mediated behavior. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Living at the dawn of a digital twenty-first century, people living in Western societies spend an increasing amount of time interacting with a terminal and interacting with others at the terminal. Because the self emerges out of interaction with others (humans and non-humans), this increasingly pervasive and mandatory interaction with terminals prompts a `terminal self'-a nexus of social and psychological orientations that are adjusted to the terminal logic. In order to trace the terminal self's profile, the book examines how five unique `default settings' of the terminal incite particular adjustments in users that transform their perceptions of reality, their experiences of self, and their relations with others. Combining traditional interactionist theory, Goffman's dramaturgy, and the French hypermodern approach, using examples from everyday life and popular culture, the book examines these adjustments, their manifestations, consequences, and resonance with broader trends of a hypermodern society organized by the `digital apparatus.' Suggesting that these adjustments infantilize users, the author proposes strategies to confront three interrelated risks faced by the terminal self and society. These risks pertain to users' subjectivity and need for recognition, to their declining abilities in face-to-face interactions, and to their dwindling abilities to retain control over terminal technologies. An accessibly written examination of the transformation of the self in the digital age, The Terminal Self will appeal to scholars of sociology, social psychology, and cultural studies with interests in digital cultures, new technologies, social interaction, and conceptions of identity. \textcopyright{} 2018 Simon Gottschalk.}

As hypothesised, preference for online social interaction mediated the vulnerable narcissism\textemdash phubbing relationship, however this effect was only partial, with narcissistic vulnerability still having a significant and positive direct effect on phubbing. These results indicate that phubbing may allow individuals with vulnerable narcissism to meet contingent self-esteem needs\textemdash i.e., needs which are more readily managed through the asynchronous and more controllable online environment\textemdash but that other aspects of narcissistic vulnerability also drive phubbing behaviours. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd}

Online tools and services can facilitate individuals leaving abusive relationships, yet they can also act as a barrier to departure. They may also enable abusive behaviors. A comprehensive literature search of published and unpublished studies in electronic databases was conducted. Two researchers independently screened abstracts and full texts for study eligibility and evaluated the quality of included studies. The systematic review includes 22 studies (9 qualitative and 11 cross-sectional studies, a randomized control trial [RCT] and a nonrandomized study [NRS]) published between 2004 and 2017. Four covert behaviors linked to covert online strategies around IPV were identified: presence online, granular control, use of digital support tools and services, and stalking and surveillance. The same technology that provides individuals with easy access to information and supportive services related to IPV, such as digital devices, tools, and services, also enables perpetrators to monitor or harass their partners. This review takes a rigorous interdisciplinary approach to synthesizing knowledge on the covert strategies adopted by people in relation to IPV. It has particular relevance to practitioners who support survivors in increasing awareness of the role of digital technologies in IPV, to law enforcement agencies in identifying new forms of evidence of abuse, and in enabling designers of online/social media applications to take the needs and vulnerabilities of IPV survivors into account. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.}

Other personality factors, such as the Big Five Personality factors, honesty\textendash humility and negative social potency, may also play a role in cyber-bullying, which is an aggressive behavior similar to trolling. The purpose of this study was to predict Facebook trolling behavior based on personality factors. A total of 139 participants com-pleted a survey on their online behavior and personality factors. Online trolling behavior positively correlated with sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, and negatively correlated with agree-ableness, conscientiousness and honesty\textendash humility. A hierarchical linear regression showed that sadism, Machiavellianism and negative social potency were the only unique predictors of online trolling behavior. Trolling was unrelated to the frequency of Facebook use and the frequency of commenting. Enjoyment of trolling fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and the trolling behavior. The results thus suggested that Facebook trolling behaviors may be motivated by enjoying the manipulation of others. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.}

Method: In all, 97 veterans undergoing neuropsychological evaluation in a VA outpatient clinic completed the MMPI-2-RF and the MCMI-III. We examined the psychometric properties of the scales and proposed additional scales based on personality constructs found in other established tests and prior versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM; APA, 2013). Results: The 10 original and three additional scales demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. Most of the 13 scales correlated strongly with the corresponding MCMI-III scale, however, DSM criteria coverage was variable between scales. Conclusion: These data provide additional support for 10 personality disorder spectra scales based on MMPI-2-RF items and establish preliminary evidence for three additional scales. Further validation is needed in larger and diverse samples. Published 2020. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA}

A qualitative study on the perception of cyber stalking and the adequacy of the anti-stalking law to regulate such crime in Malaysia is somewhat scarce. Hence, this paper seeks to examine cyber stalking risks and the sufficiency of laws to govern such crime and the legal protection afforded to victims. This paper adopts a qualitative methodology, where the data is obtained from eighteen semi-structured interviews conducted with various stakeholders, including the regulators and enforcement officers. Secondary data involves cyber legislation, the Penal Code, and online sources. The findings suggest that cyber stalking risks are often manufactured by the victims, which lead to individual responsibility towards managing and mitigating such risks. The findings have significant implications for lawmakers to either enact specific laws on cyber stalking or amend the Penal Code to include such crime. \textcopyright{} 2018 International Journal of Cyber Criminology.}

With the advent of review websites and forums, companies and business owners may find themselves victims of consumer cyber aggression, which can hurt a company badly. This study aims to explore why consumers would engage in cyber aggression against companies, and to that end, it examines consumers' ethical orientation and other possible drivers of cyber aggression. Design/methodology/approach: To examine how ethical orientation affects consumers' intention to engage in cyber aggression, a scenario-based 2 \texttimes{} 2 (deontological: moral/immoral \texttimes{} teleological: good result/bad result) between-subject experimental design is used. Moreover, 26 possible drivers in related literature are identified and included in a questionnaire administered to 226 college students. Findings: The results show that adult consumers' deontological and teleological evaluations significantly affect their ethical judgment about engaging in cyber aggression, which further impacts their intention to perpetrate an act of cyber aggression. Moreover, the study identifies six factors contributing to cyber aggression engagement as follows: personal aggressiveness, ease of perpetration, internet negativity, personal gains, helping the company and recreation. Originality/value: Cyber aggression is generally viewed as interpersonal violence among adolescents. This study views cyber aggression from a different perspective and it is one of the few studies to look at adult consumers' motivations to engage in cyber aggression against companies. The findings of this study can help firms understand why their customers attack them online, and understanding that will enable businesses to formulate more effective responses to attacks. \textcopyright{} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

Without education in psychology and morals, children will grow up with difficulty in controlling their emotions and behaviour. Currently, various psychological and moral problems are associated with children such a stress leading to suicide, drug addiction, gangsterism, bullying, rape and so on. These social ills may be overcome by giving solid education at home. Fathers as head of their families have a big responsibility to educate their youn g to be morally sound human beings. Hence, the purpose of this research is to identify the fathers` practice of fulfilling this responsibility in providing education in psychology and morals to their young. This research is designed as a survey study. 100 respondents among final year Islamic Studies students were selected by group sampling from four Malaysian public universities, namely, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), University of Malaya (UM), Putra University of Malaysia (UPM) and International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM). Research data was descriptively analysed using SPSS version 23.0. Research results find that the psychological aspect emphasized by fathers in educating their children is item, {$\twolowline$}My father always showed me love in his speech and actions` (mean=3.51). In the moral aspect, the item with the hi ghest mean is {$\twolowline$}My father teaches me not to harbour feelings of malicious envy` (mean=3.47).

This book expands the lens of Cyberpsychology to consider how digital experiences play out across the various stages of people's lives. Most psychological research has focused on whether human-technology interactions are a 'good' or a 'bad' thing for humanity. This book offers a distinctive approach to the emergent area of Cyberpsychology, moving beyond these binary dilemmas and considering how popular technologies have come to frame human experience and relationships. In particular the authors explore the role of significant life stages in defining the evolving purpose of digital technologies. They discuss how people's symbiotic relationship with digital technologies has started to redefine our childhoods, how we experience ourselves, how we make friends, our experience of being alone, how we have sex and form romantic relationships, our capacity for being antisocial as well as the experience of growing older and dying. This interdisciplinary book will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners across psychology, digital technology and media studies as well as anyone interested in how technology influences our behaviour. \textcopyright{} The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Despite important social functions gossip has a rather negative reputation. Therefore, the present online study focuses on the reasons why people gossip and how these reasons are related to personality (i.e., dark triad) and situational settings. Six distinct motives were identified that underlie gossip behavior: information validation, information gathering, relationship building, protection, social enjoyment, and negative influence. The most important motive was validating information about the gossip target followed by the motive to acquire new information about the gossip target. The least important motive was harming the gossip target. The motivational pattern was highly similar between private and work context. Interestingly, the importance of motives mainly depends on the gossiper's narcissism both in work and in private settings. The findings suggest that the negative reputation of gossip is not justified. In fact, even "dark" personalities appear to use gossip to tune their picture of other humans and themselves and not to harm others. \textcopyright{} 2019 Hartung, Krohn and Pirschtat.}

We found that participants who frequently use aggressive and self-deprecating humor were more likely to violate others' privacy by sharing photos. We also replicated the interventions' paradoxical effects - increasing sharing likelihood - as reported in earlier work and identified the subgroups that demonstrated this behavior through interaction analyses. When primed to consider the subjects' privacy, only humor deniers (participants who use humor infrequently) demonstrated increased sharing.

The current study investigated whether there are distinct groups of college students who experience different forms of aggression and victimization using latent profile analysis (LPA), and whether these groups differ from one another in their maladaptive personality characteristics and psychopathology symptoms. Participants were 540 undergraduate students from a Midwestern university (53\% female; 78.5\% White; average age = 19.27 years). Four profiles were identified: Non-Involved (80.7\%), Traditional Victim-Only (10.3\%), Traditional Aggressor/Victim (4.8\%), and Combined Aggressor/Victim (traditional aggression, cyber aggression and victimization; 4.1\%). Maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology symptoms differed across the four groups. Both the traditional aggressor/victim group and the combined aggressor/victim group, compared to the non-involved and traditional victim-only group, reported higher levels of narcissism, psychopathy, and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. The traditional aggressor/victim group, compared to the combined aggressor/victim group, reported higher levels of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and CU traits. The combined aggressor/victim group reported higher levels of psychopathology symptoms (i.e., emotion dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and stress) compared to the traditional aggressor/victim group. These findings enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity in experiences with aggression and victimization among college students, and highlight the importance of developing interventions that target their specific mental health needs. \textcopyright{} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

However, the young population is particularly vulnerable to becoming victims of violence or online abuse. The aim of this study was to understand to which extent the personality factors (extraversion, narcissism, lack of empathy and disinhibition) are related to sexting and online grooming victimization. The participants were 1763 adolescents between 12 and 16 years (M = 14.56, SD = 1.16, 50.99\% girls). A cross-sectional design with self-report data was used, analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicated that boys are more frequently involved in sexting and online grooming activities than girls. Personality profiles differ between sexual-erotic online behaviors, with different patterns for boys and girls. While the combination of a variety of personal characteristics such as narcissism, lack of empathy, disinhibition and extraversion predicts erotic online activities in boys, the personality factors that best predict such online risk behavior in girls are narcissism and disinhibition. When parents or educators perceive that children are showing narcissistic and uninhibited behaviors on social media and the internet, it may be beneficial to assess their sexual-erotic online activities in order to intervene and protect them from becoming victims of online harassment. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

Preventing and limiting the behaviour will require more understanding of how mutable variables relate to it. There is some evidence linking higher psychopathy scores to cyberbullying, but the cognitive processes involved in `moral disengagement' may provide better candidates for intervention. Aims: To test the hypothesis that psychopathy scores and moral disengagement ratings would each be associated with cyberbullying, but that sex and age would moderate any associations. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 334 11 to 15-year-olds (162 girls, 172 boys) from two French schools. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire which measured cyberbullying, psychopathy traits and moral disengagement. Results: We found a significant relationship between moral disengagement scale scores and cyberbullying ratings, but a stronger relationship between psychopathy scores and likelihood of cyberbullying. Neither sex nor age of the students affected these relationships. Conclusion: This study adds to existing knowledge in showing that enduring personal qualities, as captured by a self-rated psychopathy scale, may increase the risk of cyberbullying among adolescents. The findings suggest that teachers should be helped to monitor students' emotional and cognitive social skills and consider extra support for those who struggle to recognise or process others' distress. \textcopyright{} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

Data were collected from each participant by assessing a demographic questionnaire, the Composite Scale of Morningness for circadian preference, Empathy, Cyberbully and Victim Scales. The most important result was that gender, empathy, and Composite Scale of Morningness scores were the predictors for cyberbullying and cybervictimization, and as a consequence, male and evening-oriented adolescents scored higher on cyberbullying and cybervictimization. Additionally, it was observed that cyberbullying and empathy were inversely correlated in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

Research is needed to better understand, and ultimately to prevent, trolling behavior. To this end, the current study examined potential demographic and psychosocial predictors of social media trolling behavior in a collegiate population. Methods: College students (N = 504; 82\% female) completed an online survey in which they provided demographics, information about their social media habits, and responses to validated personality and psychosocial assessment instruments. Participants were categorized as positive or negative for trolling behavior based on their self-reported social media habits. Results: Based on the final regression model, significant predictors of trolling included male gender, greater need for participation in social media, and greater likelihood to make downward social comparisons on social media. Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide new information that may help to identify those at risk of engaging in trolling behavior. These findings contribute to a developing literature that may lead to prevention and intervention strategies to reduce negative outcomes and to improve online experiences for everyone. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

However, problematic SNS use (PSNSU) may be associated with negative personality traits. The present study investigated the associations between PSNSU, dark triad personality traits, and emotion dysregulation. Method: In the present study, 555 SNS users (Mage = 33.32 years, SD = 10.88) completed an online survey comprising measures of PSNSU, dark triad personality traits, and emotion dysregulation. Results: Bivariate correlations showed that PSNSU was significantly associated with dark triad traits as well as emotion dysregulation. Structural equation modelling (where the effect of the dark triad traits on PSNSU was mediated by emotion dysregulation) showed that 33.5\% of the variance of PSNSU was explained by Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Conclusion: The findings provide suggestive evidence of why PSNSU may occur as a function of the presence of dark triad traits and emotion dysregulation. The study also highlighted the important role that emotion regulation plays in the association between dark triad traits and PSNSU. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).}

The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate studies examining the association between problematic SNS use and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Sampling and Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PsychInfo, PsycArticles, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Problematic SNS use (PSNSU) and its synonyms were included in the search. Information was extracted based on problematic SNS use and psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and stress. The inclusion criteria for papers to be reviewed were (i) being published since 2014 onwards, (ii) being published in English, (iii) having population-based studies with sample sizes {$>$}500 participants, (iv) having specific criteria for problematic SNS use (typically validated psychometric scales), and (v) containing empirical primary data reporting on the correlation between PSNSU and psychiatric variables. A total of nine studies met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The findings of the systematic review demonstrated that most research has been conducted in Europe and all comprised cross-sectional survey designs. In eight (of the nine) studies, problematic SNS use was correlated with psychiatric disorder symptoms. Of the nine studies (some of which examined more than one psychiatric symptom), there was a positive association between PSNSU and depression (seven studies), anxiety (six studies), stress (two studies), ADHD (one study), and OCD (one study). Conclusions: Overall, the studies reviewed showed associations between PSNSU and psychiatric disorder symptoms, particularly in adolescents. Most associations were found between PSNSU, depression, and anxiety. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Hussain and Griffiths.}

There is, however, some agreement on its associated features, such as intentional behaviour towards an individual or group. As dependency on the internet and electronic devices grows in terms of social interaction, so does a need to identify, understand, and intervene, in aggressive, hostile, and victimising situations. This chapter proposes an argument to widen the net when examining cyberbullying, through adopting the term `cyberaggression', an inclusive term for the various forms of hostile, direct and indirect behaviour which occur in the online sphere. Examining these forms through the lens of cyberaggression will allow for a more holistic and unified approach to understanding victimisation in the online environment. This case is made with the support of theory and research from the fields of bullying and aggression, and has further implications for legislation, policy holders and researchers alike. \textcopyright{} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.}

Since there is a generational gap in internet use between young and older people, two experiments were conducted, each focusing on one of these populations. A series of analyses identified that IA and functional/technical service failure partially influenced four different types of customers' word-of-mouth (eWOM) behaviors on social media (i.e., Badmouthing, Tattling, Spite and Feeding the Vultures). Data were analyzed with sets of four multivariate regression models to evaluate eWOM behaviors. The findings suggest that both young and older customers represented more negative eWOMs when they experienced technical service failures. The findings were not consistent regarding functional service failures. IA was not a consistent predictor of young customers' negative eWOM, but it was a consistent predictor of older customers' negative eWOM for all service failure categories. \textcopyright{} 2019}

To investigate this relationship, we conducted two experimental tests involving actual Facebook users recruited from Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk platform. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that the use of a true self-presentation style leads to greater self-reported happiness for high self-esteem users compared to low self-esteem users. By contrast, the use of a strategic self-presentation style results in more self-reported happiness for both high- and low-self-esteem users. Following self-determination theory, which emphasizes the importance of feeling effective in one's environment, a mediation test was further conducted in Experiment 2, demonstrating that revealing a true self on Facebook effectively satisfies the high self-esteem user's need for competence, thus explaining greater degrees of self-reported happiness. \textcopyright{} 2018}

Results showed that a variable-centered approach is appropriate in understanding the Dark Triad, and yet individuals scoring high on one Dark Triad dimension also tend to score high on other dimensions. Based on these results, we concluded that it is appropriate to study individual differences in the Dark Triad (inferences based on persons) by capturing the common variance among the three traits using a variable-centered approach, rather than treating these traits as independent or uncoordinated characteristics. \textcopyright{} 2016 Kam, Zhou.

In order to demonstrate convergence of finding and replicability of the proposed relationships, four studies were conducted to examine consumers' intention to exaggerate about their positive and negative experiences in online reviews for search and experience products respectively. Findings showed significant positive relationships between dark personality traits and intention to exaggerate in online reviews. Furthermore, moral disengagement significantly mediated intention to exaggerate for narcissists and psychopaths. The results reinforce the usefulness of the study for managers as these studies augment the understanding of consumer lying behavior in the context of online reviews and offer insights into mechanisms that might prevent the amplification of such reviews. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd}

Correlational and experimental research examining this relation has received growing attention. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the influence of sexualizing media use on self-objectification among women and men. For this purpose, we analyzed 54 papers yielding 50 independent studies and 261 effect sizes. The data revealed a positive, moderate effect of sexualizing media on self-objectification (r =.19). The effect was significant and robust, 95\% CI [.15,.23], p {$<$}.0001. We identified a conditional effect of media type, suggesting that the use of video games and/or online media led to stronger self-objectification effects when compared to television use. Other sample characteristics or study characteristics did not moderate the overall effect. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of sexualizing media exposure on women's and men's objectified self-concept. We discuss future research directions and implications for practice. We hope that the article will stimulate researchers in their future work to address the research gaps outlined here.

Despite considerable studies directed at its examination, the current research on cyberstalking is limited by a lack of clarity on its characterization and prevalence, coupled with a fragmented research focus. To address this limitation, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on cyberstalking has been undertaken. Rigorous protocols were applied to identify 49 empirical studies via Scopus and Web of Science, based on specific keywords and article selection criteria. Findings reveal four emergent research themes on characteristics and roles of cyberstalkers, victims, parents, social media, and online service providers, as well as reporting, coping, and prevention strategies discussed in prior studies. Findings imply the need for temporal and cross-cultural validation of measurement scales and prior results by developing sophisticated, theoretically-grounded frameworks. Based on study findings, a research framework is proposed to assist researchers in future examinations of under-investigated associations and constructs. Implications arise for studying potential pre-emptive factors to address cyberstalking at a societal level by disseminating appropriate information to the general public. There is a need to develop stringent legislation and to induce service providers' active participation to prevent cyberstalking. \textcopyright{} 2020}

  abstract = {Over the past few years, a notable trend has emerged in social networking sites (SNSs). With the growing popularity of image-based SNSs such as Instagram, users increasingly communicate and present themselves by posting photographs they take of themselves ("selfies"). As the phenomenon of selfies becomes widespread across a range of SNSs as a unique means of self-presentation, an interesting question arises, what makes people post their selfies on SNSs. To delve into this rising issue, the present study investigates the antecedents of selfie-posting behavior on SNSs by applying and extending Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). A conceptual model, which is primarily drawn from the TPB and incorporates narcissism as an additional antecedent, is proposed and empirically tested. Results show that attitude toward selfie-posting, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and narcissism are the significant determinants of an individual's intention to post selfies on SNSs. Further, one's selfie-posting behavior on SNSs is significantly predicted by his or her intention to post selfies. Implications of the findings are discussed with suggestions for future research. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

High-level features were extracted using Computer Vision and Emotion Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, and low-level features were extracted utilizing the program written by the authors. The results of correlation analysis indicate that narcissism, life satisfaction, and loneliness were significantly associated with a part of photograph features at high- and low-levels. The results of the predictive analysis suggest that narcissism, loneliness in total, and social loneliness could be predicted with acceptable accuracy from Instagram photograph features, while characteristics such as life satisfaction, family loneliness, and romantic loneliness could not be predicted. Implications of this research and suggestions for further research were presented. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Kim, Nan and Kim.}

  abstract = {Organizations maintain social media accounts and upload posts to show their activities and communicate with the public, as individual users do. Thus, organizations' social media accounts can be examined from the same perspective of that of individual users' accounts, with personality being one of the perspectives. In line with previous studies that analyzed the personality of nonhuman objects such as products, stores, brands, and websites, this study analyzed the personality of Instagram accounts of public health organizations. It also extracted features at content and pixel levels from the photos uploaded on the organizations' accounts and examined how they were related to the personality traits of the accounts. The results suggested that the personality of public health organizations can be summarized as being high in openness and agreeableness but lower in extraversion and neuroticism. Openness and agreeableness were the personality traits associated the most with the content-level features, while extraversion and neuroticism were the ones associated the most with the pixel-level features. In addition, for each of the two traits associated the most with either the content-or pixel-level features, their associations tended to be in opposite directions with one another. The personality traits, except for neuroticism, were predicted from the photo features with an acceptable level of accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.}

The emphasis in the paper is placed on the problematic issues of the legal practice of combating cyberbullying and cyber-mobbing in developing countries as these phenomena are still insufficiently studied. The subject of this paper is modern internet phenomena such as cyberbullying and cyber-mobbing. The emphasis in the paper is placed on the problematic issues of the legal practice of combating cyberbullying and cyber-mobbing in developing countries as these phenomena are still insufficiently studied. Design/methodology/approach: The legislation of developing countries is compared with doctrinal and practical developments in the fight against the studied problem in developed countries of the West, as well as countries of the former USSR. Moreover, experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of methods to combat cyberbullying using social networks. Thus, 40 random accounts of people (presumably from 18 to 30 years old) were analyzed. Findings: This paper indicates the concepts of cyber-mobbing and cyberbullying, as well as their varieties that exist in the modern world. This study examines statistical data, programs and measures of different states in the fight against cyberbullying and cyber-mobbing. Results of experiments showed that Instagram users are aware of the availability of built-in extensions of the social network to protect against cyberbullying and use them relatively frequently. With that, female segment of Instagram users is more concerned about the content of the comments under their photos than the male one. Originality/value: Measures have been developed to prevent and counteract cyberbullying and cyber-mobbing, the introduction of which into the policies of states might help in the fight against these social phenomena. \textcopyright{} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

Mediation analyses showed narcissism was indirectly associated with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample. Sadism was directly associated with POG among first-person shooter game players and indirectly with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample.

A total of 478 online gamers completed a self-report online survey, including validated psychometric scales assessing the aforementioned constructs. Results indicated that trait EI was directly and indirectly associated with IGD and that the motive of escape was a partial mediator between trait EI and IGD among the total sample and adult gamers, but not among adolescents. Moreover, trait EI was associated with coping, skill development, fantasy, and recreation gaming motives only among total sample and adult gamers, and the escape motive was positively associated with IGD among total sample and adult gamers. However, among these relationships, only the association between trait EI and fantasy was significantly moderated by age group. Furthermore, the direct effect of trait EI was stronger among adolescent gamers when compared to adult gamers. Results showed that trait EI is inversely associated with IGD and affects gaming for different motives among adolescent and adult gamers. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).}

A total of 344 university students volunteered to complete a questionnaire that included measures on the aforementioned dimensions. Thirty-eight percent of the participants had emotional neglect and 27\% had emotional abuse, while 44\% of them demonstrated at least one cyberbullying perpetration behavior. Results indicated that cyberbullying perpetrators had higher scores on problematic social media use, dissociative experiences, Cluster B traits, depression and childhood emotional trauma, and lower on self-esteem. Path analysis demonstrated that, while adjusting for gender and age, childhood emotional trauma was directly and indirectly associated with cyberbullying perpetration via Cluster B traits. Moreover, depression and dissociation were directly associated with problematic social media use.

The sample comprised 1008 undergraduate students, aged between 17 and 32 years (M = 20.49, SD = 1.73; 60.5\% women). The participants completed a questionnaire comprising the Social Media Use Questionnaire, Social Media Usage Aims Scale, and Ten-Item Personality Inventory. Multiple linear and hierarchical regression analyses showed that social media use motives of (i) meeting new people and socializing, (ii) expressing or presenting a more popular self, and (iii) passing time and entertainment were associated with problematic social media use. Moreover, participants that preferred Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook reported higher scores of problematic social media use. Finally, being female, introverted, conscientious, agreeable, and neurotic were associated with PSMU. The findings offer empirical evidence for uses and gratifications theory because the findings demonstrated that (i) different personality traits predict different motives, (ii) different motives predict preference of different platforms, and (iii) different individual differences such as personality, preference of platform, and specific use motives predict PSMU. \textcopyright{} 2018, The Author(s).}

Consequently, the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of dark traits with specific online activities (i.e., social media, gaming, gambling, shopping, and sex) and PIU. Methods: A total of 772 university students completed a self-report survey, including the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Scale, Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, Spitefulness Scale, and an adapted version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis and a multiple mediation model indicated that being male was positively associated with higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling, and negatively associated with social media and online shopping. Narcissism was related to higher social media use; Machiavellianism was related to higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling; sadism was related to online sex; and spitefulness was associated with online sex, online gambling, and online shopping. Finally, Machiavellianism and spitefulness were directly and indirectly associated with PIU via online gambling, online gaming, and online shopping, and narcissism was indirectly associated with PIU through social media use. Discussion: Findings of this preliminary study show that individuals high in dark personality traits may be more vulnerable in developing problematic online use and that further research is warranted to examine the associations of dark personality traits with specific types of problematic online activities. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).}

Although there are many studies investigating the problematic use of social networking sites such as Facebook, little is known about problematic Instagram use (PIU) and factors related to it. The present study developed a complex model in order to examine the mediating role of perceived feeling of presence (i.e., social, spatial, and co-presence) and escapism between using different Instagram features and PIU. A total of 333 Instagram users from a high school and a state university, aged between 14 and 23 years (Mage = 17.74 years, SD = 2.37, 61\% female), completed a ``paper-and-pencil'' questionnaire comprising measures of social presence, spatial presence, co-presence, Instagram escapism, and PIU. In addition, frequency of use of five different Instagram features (i.e., watching live streams; watching videos; looking at posted photographs; liking, commenting on others' posts; and getting likes and comments from others) were assessed using a 7-point Likert scale. Analysis indicated that watching live streams was indirectly associated with PIU via escapism, spatial presence, and co-presence. Leaving likes and comments on others' posts was both directly and indirectly associated with PIU via co-presence and escapism. Escapism mediated the relationships between social and spatial presence and co-presence and PIU. The findings of the present study appear to indicate that a minority of individuals use Instagram problematically and that problematic Instagram use is associated with the frequency of watching live streams, liking, and commenting on others' posts on Instagram, being able to feel a higher sense of presence using Instagram, and using Instagram as an escape from reality. \textcopyright{} 2018, The Author(s).}

Three hundred and fifty-three freshman and sophomore university students from Turkey (45.9\% (n = 162) female and 54.1\% (n = 191) male) completed a questionnaire that included Cyberbullying Scale, Big-5 Inventory, Composite Scale of Morningness, and Sleep Quality Scale. The most conspicuous result of the study was that chronotype and sleep quality were significant predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. Evening-type students had significantly higher scores on cyberbullying scale than neither-type students and morning-type students, and also neither-type students had higher scores on cyberbullying scale than morning-type students. Further, poorer sleep quality, being male, higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness were related to higher cyberbullying perpetration. \textcopyright{} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

A total of 437 independent studies were located, which included 123,043 participants. Narcissism was related to both aggression (r = .26, [.24, .28]) and violence (r = .23, [.18, .27]). As expected, the narcissism-aggression link was stronger under provocation conditions (r = .29, [.23, .36]) than under no provocation conditions (r = .12, [.05, .18]), but was even significant in the absence of provocation. Both ``normal'' and ``pathological'' narcissism were related to aggression. All three dimensions of narcissism (i.e., entitlement, grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism) were related to aggression. Narcissism was related to all forms of aggression (i.e., indirect, direct, displaced, physical, verbal, bullying), and to both functions of aggression (i.e., reactive, proactive). The relation between narcissism and aggression was significant for males and females, for people of all ages, for students and nonstudents, and for people from individualistic and collectivistic countries. Significant results were obtained in experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies, in published and unpublished studies, and in studies that assessed aggression using different types of measures (i.e., self-report, other-report, observation). Overall results were robust to publication bias and the presence of outliers. Theoretically, these results indicate that provocation is a key moderator of the link between narcissism and aggression. Individuals high in narcissism have ``thin skins'' and are prone to aggression when they are provoked. Practically, these results suggest that narcissism is an important risk factor for aggression and violence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement\textemdash This meta-analytic review found that individuals with high levels of narcissism are prone to aggressive and violent behavior, especially when they are provoked.

  abstract = {Incivility in online political discussions is an urgent problem for society as it can have detrimental effects on democratic discourse. However, knowledge about people's inherent motives for behaving in an uncivil way is scarce. To close this gap, this online study employed a mixed-methods approach and surveyed 115 discussion commenters to explore their motives for communicating in an uncivil manner. Qualitative analyses revealed that in individual cases, people's motives for uncivil commenting can be very complex, and differ between distinct forms of incivility. Participants also indicated that they often try to counteract other comments. In contrast, quantitative data revealed that motives related to aggression were the key drivers for frequent uncivil commenting behavior among different forms of incivility. In sum, the study demonstrated that although aggressive motives are not the only predictors of uncivil commenting, they still seem to be a key factor for an individual's tendency to write uncivil comments. \textcopyright{} 2020 ACM.}

In contrast to this, less extreme forms of uncivil online behavior have received only little attention. The current paper strives to overcome this research gap by focusing on uncivil commenting intentions in public Facebook discussions. We presented controversial online comments to a convenient student sample of 256 Facebook users asking them to consider their likely response on several scales ranging from a functional to an uncivil style of reasoning. Users' intended commenting was then linked to several personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) and their Facebook intensity. Analyses revealed openness, agreeableness, and experience seeking as negative predictors of participants' intention to comment uncivilly, whereas attentional impulsivity, boredom susceptibility as well as intense Facebook use emerged as positive predictors. No connections were found for the Dark Triad. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

A ``gamer'' became a new social first for the group of individuals who played video games (primarily in arcades) in the late 1970's. Over time, however, gamer cultures have grown into what is largely discussed as ``toxic cultures,'' and come to become more associated with exclusion than inclusion if you don't fit a certain mold. Despite its prevalence, deviant behaviors in games as a subject of academic study is a confusing space, with different researchers using different criteria to describe the same things. This article provides the first comprehensive cataloging and overview of dark participation in games.

  abstract = {The Internet has evolved into a ubiquitous and indispensable digital environment in which people communicate, seek information, and make decisions. Despite offering various benefits, online environments are also replete with smart, highly adaptive choice architectures designed primarily to maximize commercial interests, capture and sustain users' attention, monetize user data, and predict and influence future behavior. This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain with commercial players. One way to address some of this imbalance is with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over their digital environments, in part by boosting their information literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation. Our goal is to present a conceptual map of interventions that are based on insights from psychological science. We begin by systematically outlining how online and offline environments differ despite being increasingly inextricable. We then identify four major types of challenges that users encounter in online environments: persuasive and manipulative choice architectures, AI-assisted information architectures, false and misleading information, and distracting environments. Next, we turn to how psychological science can inform interventions to counteract these challenges of the digital world. After distinguishing among three types of behavioral and cognitive interventions\textemdash nudges, technocognition, and boosts\textemdash we focus on boosts, of which we identify two main groups: (a) those aimed at enhancing people's agency in their digital environments (e.g., self-nudging, deliberate ignorance) and (b) those aimed at boosting competencies of reasoning and resilience to manipulation (e.g., simple decision aids, inoculation). These cognitive tools are designed to foster the civility of online discourse and protect reason and human autonomy against manipulative choice architectures, attention-grabbing techniques, and the spread of false information. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.}

Understanding the causes, forms, and consequences of aggression and violence is critical for dealing with these harmful forms of social behavior. Addressing a range of sub-topics, the first part deals with the definition and measurement of aggression, presents major theories, examines the development of aggression and discusses individual and gender differences in aggressive behaviour. It covers the role of situational factors in eliciting aggression and the impact of exposure to violence in the media. The second part examines specific forms and manifestations of aggression, including chapters on aggression in everyday contexts and in the family, sexual aggression, intergroup aggression, and terrorism. The new edition also includes additional coverage of gender differences, gun violence, and terrorism, to reflect the latest research developments in the field. Also discussing strategies for reducing and preventing aggression, this book is essential reading for students and researchers in psychology and related disciplines, as well as practitioners and policy makers. \textcopyright{} 2021 Barbara Krah\'e.}

At the same time, observers have noted an increase of individuals behaving in an unrestrained manner on the Internet, while researchers have reported elevated rates of cyber aggressive behavior. What remains unclear, however, is whether, and how, disinhibition might be related to cyber aggression. In an aim to explore the possible associations, a large sample (total N = 709) of high school (M age = 15.56 years) respondents from New Zealand were recruited, and completed a survey featuring scales assessing personality and technology behaviors, attitudes, habits, and trends. The present study was designed to investigate whether the three dark personality traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism would predict false self perceptions, and in sequence, online disinhibition and aggressive online behavior. All three dark personality traits, as well as false self, were positively associated with online disinhibition. Perceptions of false self were found to be a significant predictor of cyber aggression when mediated by online disinhibition. In the case of cyber aggression, however, psychopathy, sadistic traits, and online disinhibition were found to be significant predictors of this outcome. The results collectively provide a more nuanced understanding of how antisocial personality traits are associated with maladaptive identity formation (i.e., endorsement of false self beliefs) as well as maladaptive online behavior. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

It does so by exploring the synergy between the feminist perspectives and the Tripartite Cybercrime Framework (TCF) (which argues that three possible factors motivate cybercrimes \textendash{} socioeconomic, psychosocial, and geopolitical) to critique mainstream criminology and the meaning of the term ``cybercrime''. Additionally, the article examines gender gaps in online harassment, cyber-bullying, cyber-fraud, revenge porn, and cyber-stalking to demonstrate that who is victimised, why, and to what effect are the critical starting points for the analysis of the connections between gender and crimes. In turn, it uses the lens of intersectionality to acknowledge that, while conceptions of gender and crime interact, they intersect with other categories (e.g., sexuality) to provide additional layers of explanation. To nuance the utilitarian value of the synergy between the TCF and the feminist perspectives, the focus shifts to a recent case study (which compared socioeconomic and psychosocial cybercrimes). The article concludes that, while online and offline lives are inextricably intertwined, the victimisations in psychosocial cybercrimes may be more gendered than in socioeconomic cybercrimes. These contributions align the TCF to the feminist epistemology of crime in their attempt to move gender analysis of digital crimes ``from margin to centre''. \textcopyright{} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd}

One of the existing issues is the small effect sizes that showed that the traits outlined by the Five-Factor model are lacking the required specificity to predict specific behaviours such as SNS addiction. In light of this issue, the present research attempted to predict SNS addiction with the Dark Triad traits that have been linked to impulsivity that is central to the development of SNS addiction. In this study, a sample of 204 (Male = 77, 38\%; Female = 124, 60\%; Not mentioned = 3, 2\%; M age = 22.94, SD age = 3.43) university students in Malaysia completed the Big Five Inventory, the Short Dark Triad, and the adapted Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results indicated that SNS addiction was significantly predicted by the measured psychopathy of the Dark Triad. In predicting SNS addiction, the inclusion of the Dark Triad traits contributed significant amount of variance after controlling the Five-Factor model.

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of social networks has increased exponentially, which has led to a significant increase in cyberbullying. Currently, in the field of Computer Science, research has been made on how to detect aggressiveness in texts, which is a prelude to detecting cyberbullying. In this field, the main work has been done for English language texts, mainly using Machine Learning (ML) approaches, Lexicon approaches to a lesser extent, and very few works using hybrid approaches. In these, Lexicons and Machine Learning algorithms are used, such as counting the number of bad words in a sentence using a Lexicon of bad words, which serves as an input feature for classification algorithms. This research aims at contributing towards detecting aggressiveness in Spanish language texts by creating different models that combine the Lexicons and ML approach. Twenty-two models that combine techniques and algorithms from both approaches are proposed, and for their application, certain hyperparameters are adjusted in the training datasets of the corpora, to obtain the best results in the test datasets. Three Spanish language corpora are used in the evaluation: Chilean, Mexican, and Chilean-Mexican corpora. The results indicate that hybrid models obtain the best results in the 3 corpora, over implemented models that do not use Lexicons. This shows that by mixing approaches, aggressiveness detection improves. Finally, a web application is developed that gives applicability to each model by classifying tweets, allowing evaluating the performance of models with external corpus and receiving feedback on the prediction of each one for future research. In addition, an API is available that can be integrated into technological tools for parental control, online plugins for writing analysis in social networks, and educational tools, among others. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

We argue that to be effective, scientific research into misinformation must be considered within a larger political, technological, and societal context. The post-truth world emerged as a result of societal mega-trends such as a decline in social capital, growing economic inequality, increased polarization, declining trust in science, and an increasingly fractionated media landscape. We suggest that responses to this malaise must involve technological solutions incorporating psychological principles, an interdisciplinary approach that we describe as ``technocognition.''

As such, this research seeks to use the principles of semantics and pragmatics, and language policy and planning to analyse cyberbullying through the content analysis method. This research focuses primarily on cyberbullying word categories, the relationship between word use and forms of cyberbullying, the consequences of cyberbullying, and potential protocols for addressing this phenomenon. The primary findings reveal that internet users prefer strong or directly offensive words to mild or indirectly offensive language when the intention is to attack others or to express anger online. Contextual factors are primary and influential elements which may enable detection and/or prevention of cyberbullying.

We analyzed our data by creating three different groups, depending on participants' answers concerning ITPV, i.e., the overall sample, abusers' and victims' groups. Our main results suggested significant, positive correlations between ITPV perpetration and victimization, moral disengagement, psychological distress, and online disinhibition. Age negatively correlated with IPVT victimization and perpetration. We also found significant associations between participants' dominant relationship attachment style and their own and partners' cheating behavior, as well as ITPV-victimization and perpetration. Finally, 13.7\% to 23\% of participants in all three groups considered that the Covid-19 increased the frequency of ITPV behaviors (for both abusers and victims).

Different types of cyberbullying have different characteristics. However, existing cyberbullying detection works are not targeted towards any of these specific types. This research is tailored to focus on sexual harassment type of cyberbullying and proposes a novel dictionary of approach words. Since cyberbullying is a growing threat to the mental health and intellectual development of adolescents in the society, models targeted towards the detection of specific type of online bullying or predation should be encouraged among social network researchers. \textcopyright{} 2021 Syed Mahbub et al.}

In a moderated mediation model, this study proposes that problematic social media use by workers during COVID-19 is linked to fear of COVID-19, which is further associated with depression. The current study tested trait mindfulness as an important personal resource that may be associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 despite problematic social media use. The study collected temporally separate data to avoid common method bias. Pakistani employees (N = 267) working in different organizations completed a series of survey questionnaires. The results supported the moderated mediation model, showing that problematic social media use during the current pandemic is linked to fear of COVID-19 and depression among employees. Furthermore, trait mindfulness was found to be an important buffer, reducing the negative indirect association between problematic social media use and depression through fear of COVID-19. These results offer implications for practitioners. The limitations of this study and future research directions are also discussed. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Majeed, Irshad, Fatima, Khan and Hassan.}

The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a new perspective on online hating by, first, distinguishing online hating from the phenomena it is often confused with, such as trolling, cyberstalking, and online hate speech, and, second, by proposing an operational definition of online hating and online haters based on ethnographic interviews and surveys of the existing scholarly literature.

Accompanying the benefits of online dating is the potential for new, distinct forms of antisocial behaviour online, such as trolling. The current study (N = 357) sought to explore the antisocial behaviour of trolling on Location-Based Real-Time Dating applications (i.e., LBRTD apps) in an online sample of Australians sourced from the community. Specifically, we examined the role of participant's sex and of the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and impulsivity in predicting perpetration of trolling behaviours on LBRTD apps. Although there were no sex differences, the traits of psychopathy, sadism, and dysfunctional impulsivity were significantly associated with trolling behaviours. Subsequent moderation analysis revealed that dysfunctional impulsivity predicts perpetration of trolling, but only if the individual has medium or high levels of trait psychopathy. Results of the current study aid in further conceptualising the personality of the Internet ``troll''. Future research should further explore antisocial online behaviours, such as other hostile behaviour that occurs on LBRTD apps. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

Tinder users (N = 1,001; 46.3\% men and 53.7\% women) with an average age of 22.42 years (SD = 4.31) completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Anger was a significant moderator of all relationships between narcissism and antisocial behaviour. Specifically, at average and high levels of anger there were positive, significant relationships between both facets of narcissism, and aggression and harassment on Tinder.

CDA includes abusive online behavior toward a current or former intimate partner, such as aggression, control, harassment, and humiliation. Despite the potential overlap and reciprocal relationship of CDA and intimate partner violence, there remains considerable paucity in research exploring predictors of this abusive online behavior. In the current study, we adopt the General Aggression Model framework and explore the role of gender, hegemonic masculinity, vulnerable narcissism, and sexual aggression myths to predict perpetration of CDA. Participants (N = 415, 51 percent women; Mage = 32.68 years) were recruited via social media advertisements and completed an anonymous, confidential online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised the Conformity to Masculine Roles Norms Inventory, the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale, the Acceptance of Modern Myths About Sexual Aggression Scale, and a modified Cyber Aggression in Relationships Scale. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that hegemonic masculinity, vulnerable narcissism, and sexual aggression myths were all significant positive predictors of perpetrating CDA. As gender was a significant predictor until the inclusion of these variables, a multiple mediation analysis was performed, indicating that both hegemonic masculinity and sexual aggression myths fully mediated the relationship between gender and perpetrating CDA. These results add to the growing body of research exploring how CDA emerges as a behavior and highlight possible implications for management and intervention. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.}

Previous research has shown that gender (specifically, male), trait psychopathy, and trait sadism significantly predict engaging in trolling. In this study, we sought to replicate and extend previous research by exploring the role of self-esteem in predicting trolling, and possible interactions between self-esteem and personality. Participants (n = 400, 67.5 percent women, average age = 24.97 years [SD = 8.84]) completed an online questionnaire, including measures of psychopathy, sadism, self-esteem, and trolling behaviors. Results corroborated previous research showing gender (male) to be a significant predictor of trolling, and trait psychopathy and sadism to be significant positive predictors. Although self-esteem had no additional value on top of trait psychopathy and sadism in explaining trolling, there was a significant interaction between self-esteem and trait sadism. A moderation analysis indicated a positive relationship between self-esteem and trolling, but only when trait sadism was high. These results portray the troll as a callous individual may enjoy causing psychological harm, particularly if their self-esteem is high. These results contribute to building the psychological profile of trolls and provide future directions for research exploring trolling behaviors. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.}

  abstract = {Automatic labelling is essential in large corpuses. Engaging in human experts to label can be challenging. Semantic understanding can differ from one labeler to another based on individual's language ability. Platforms such as AmazonTurk are not able to ensure the quality of annotations in every domain. Extensive steps such as qualification and counter checking of labels may be implemented which will increase the cost of data annotation. Thus, the higher quality of labelled data expected, the greater the cost that needs to be expended. This scenario is made worse when the language is of low resource where in this work is the Malay language. Malay is a language used mostly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei. Unlike English which has large resources to tap into the semantics of sentences, making automatic labelling faster to mature, resources in Malay language are still limited. Further compounded is the use of social media data where the text is short, unnormalized and the inherent presence of code switching. The availability of qualified native Malay labelers is also scarce. To overcome this, we devised a method to automatically label a total of 219,444 Malay tweets by using a combination of sentiment, emotion and toxicity polarities. We extend the work from Arslan et al. who proposed the use of sentiment and emotion to identify cyberbullying text. Our work added toxicity polarity in the context of automatic labelling of cyberbully tweets in Malay. We were able to employ 5 experts with formal degrees in Malay language to label our training set. We applied this method to Malay cyberbullying corpus to determine "bully"and "not bully"labels. We have tested our method on 54,867 manually labelled data and achieved high accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2020 ACM.}

However, the means by which cybervictimization may influence suicide risk remain unclear. This lack of knowledge is concerning, given widespread use of online communication among youth and the devastating public impact of suicide in adolescence. One reason for this gap in the literature is that relevant frameworks have emerged from disparate academic traditions. Contemporary social media researchers have drawn on computer-mediated communication and media effects theories to characterize the impact of social media on peer processes. Traditional suicide researchers have identified factors contributing to suicide risk. However, these frameworks have never been synthesized to demonstrate how adolescent cybervictimization influences suicide risk. Thus, the purpose of this review is twofold. First, existing research on adolescent cybervictimization and suicidal thoughts and behaviors is summarized. Then, the social media ``transformation framework'' and interpersonal suicide theories are integrated to provide a new model of the impact of cybervictimization on adolescent suicide risk. The proposed model describes how unique features of the social media environment (e.g., publicness, availability, quantifiability) shape the experience of cybervictimization and associated interpersonal risk factors for suicide. This framework may serve as a theoretical guide for future interdisciplinary approaches to the study of adolescent cybervictimization and suicide. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}

In traditional Chinese culture, people show special preference for some numbers, such as 6, 8, 10, 100, 200, etc. By analyzing the data of 6.8 million users of Sina Weibo, one of the largest online social media platforms in China, we discover that users exhibit a distinct preference for the number 200, i.e., a significant fraction of users prefer to follow 200 friends. This number, which is very close to the Dunbar number that predicts the cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships, motivates us to investigate how the preference for numbers in traditional Chinese culture is reflected on social media. We systematically portray users who prefer 200 friends and analyze their several important social features, including activity, popularity, attention tendency, regional distribution, economic level, and education level. We find that the activity and popularity of users with the preference for the number 200 are relatively lower than others. They are more inclined to follow popular users, and their social portraits change relatively slowly. Besides, users who have a stronger preference for the number 200 are more likely to be located in regions with underdeveloped economies and education. That indicates users with the preference for the number 200 are likely to be vulnerable groups in society and are easily affected by opinion leaders. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

As online communities grow, they place a greater burden on their human moderators, which increases the likelihood that people at risk may be overlooked. This study evaluated the potential for machine learning to assist online peer support by directing moderators' attention where it is most needed. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an automated triage system and the extent to which it influences moderator behavior. Methods: A machine learning classifier was trained to prioritize forum messages as green, amber, red, or crisis depending on how urgently they require attention from a moderator. This was then launched as a set of widgets injected into a popular online peer support forum hosted by ReachOut.com, an Australian Web-based youth mental health service that aims to intervene early in the onset of mental health problems in young people. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a holdout test set of manually prioritized messages. The impact on moderator behavior was measured as response ratio and response latency, that is, the proportion of messages that receive at least one reply from a moderator and how long it took for these replies to be made. These measures were compared across 3 periods: before launch, after an informal launch, and after a formal launch accompanied by training. Results: The algorithm achieved 84\% f-measure in identifying content that required a moderator response. Between prelaunch and post-training periods, response ratios increased by 0.9, 4.4, and 10.5 percentage points for messages labelled as crisis, red, and green, respectively, but decreased by 5.0 percentage points for amber messages. Logistic regression indicated that the triage system was a significant contributor to response ratios for green, amber, and red messages, but not for crisis messages. Response latency was significantly reduced (P{$<$}.001), between the same periods, by factors of 80\%, 80\%, 77\%, and 12\% for crisis, red, amber, and green messages, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the triage system made a significant and unique contribution to reducing the time taken to respond to green, amber, and red messages, but not to crisis messages, after accounting for moderator and community activity. Conclusions: The triage system was generally accurate, and moderators were largely in agreement with how messages were prioritized. It had a modest effect on response ratios, primarily because moderators were already more likely to respond to high priority content before the introduction of triage. However, it significantly and substantially reduced the time taken for moderators to respond to prioritized content. Further evaluations are needed to assess the impact of mistakes made by the triage algorithm and how changes to moderator responsiveness impact the well-being of forum members. \textcopyright{} 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In this paper, we analyze the robustness of a prior framework for tagging tweets across the dimensions of enthusiasm (labels: enthusiastic, passive) and support (labels: supportive, non-supportive). We investigate the quality of annotations in a collection of tweets about three topics, namely, cyberbullying, LGBT rights, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) in the National Football League. We train models that achieve {$>$}70\% and 80\% F1 score for classifying tweets for enthusiasm and support, respectively. We assess how text-based signals of enthusiasm and support vary depending on the different annotators. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a network analysis-based approach for combining the annotated tweets with account and hashtag mention networks. This step helps to identify top accounts and hashtags related to the considered categories (enthusiasm and support). Our work offers an alternative or supplemental classification schema and prediction model to standard sentiment analysis and stance detection. \textcopyright{} 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}

The creation of fake online profiles is a relatively recent phenomenon and research in this field is still limited. However, some underlying psychological factors are emerging. The goal of this review is to identify the characteristics of the phenomenon of fake online identities and make visible the relational dynamics that are built in the digital world. Following the guidelines indicated by PRISMA, this review examined studies exploring Psychinfo, Google Scholar, and Internet as well as the bibliographic references of the identified contributions. Search terms such as (``fake self'' or ``false self'') and (web or internet or app or social networks) and (identity) were used. These search terms initially led to the identification of 126 studies (on Psychinfo), mainly in the field of social, dynamic, developmental psychology and computer science; an additional 19 studies were identified with the other sources. Since this is a systematic review and not a meta-analysis, there were no strict inclusion criteria; however, an initial selection led to the exclusion of numerous contributions, leaving 34 studies that specifically dealt with the psychological determinants and consequences of the presentation of the false self that we summarize in this contribution. We first examine the characteristics of the online false Self, then explore how a false Self is presented online, including the different types of false selves as well as possible motivating factors. \textcopyright{} 2021 Progedit.

The present study expands theoretical and empirical work on phenomenon by assessing the psychometric properties of the Selfitis Behavior Scale among an Italian sample and by examining its unexplored mediating role in the relationships between dark triad traits and social media addiction. A total of 490 participants (53.1\% females) completed a self-report survey including socio-demographics, the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS), the Short Dark Triad Scale (SD3), and the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). Results showed the SBS had a five-factor structure with good psychometrics properties in terms of reliability coefficients and measurement invariance across gender. In addition, findings from the path model supported the mediating role of selfitis behavior in the relationships of narcissism and psychopathy with social media addiction. Machiavellianism was found to be unrelated to selfitis behavior and social media addiction. The model shed light into the previous inconsistent findings on the associations between dark triad traits and social media addiction by taking into account the key role of selfitis behavior as an underlying mechanism. The findings may explain individual differences in personality traits associated with co-dependence (i.e., the combination of the dependence on self and others and social media addiction). \textcopyright{} 2020 by the authors.

Correlations of the CAST with the Dark Triad, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and with the factors of the aggression scale are evidence of convergent validity. Moreover, sadism significantly increases the explanation of aggressive behavior. Bearing in mind the development of studies on the Dark Tetrad, the four most informative items of the CAST combined with the 12 items of the Dirty Dozen were tested using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and presented acceptable indexes of fit. Overall, the findings gather evidence of psychometric suitability of the CAST and provide a short and efficient tool to assess the Dark Tetrad. \textcopyright{} 2020. All Rights Reserved.}

Some studies have investigated the role of personality traits in different sexting behaviors within mainstream personality taxonomies like Big Five and HEXACO. However, very few studies have investigated the role of maladaptive personality factors in sexting. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between Dark Triad Personality Traits and experimental (i.e., sharing own sexts), risky (i.e., sexting under substance use and with strangers), and aggravated sexting (i.e., non-consensual sexting and sexting under pressure) across 11 countries. Methods: An online survey was completed by 6093 participants (Mage = 20.35; SDage = 3.63) from 11 different countries which covered four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, and America). Participants completed the Sexting Behaviors Questionnaire and the 12-item Dark Triad Dirty Dozen scale. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that sharing own sexts was positively predicted by Machiavellianism and Narcissism. Both risky and aggravated sexting were positively predicted by Machiavellianism and Psychopathy. Conclusions: The present study provided empirical evidence that different sexting behaviors were predicted by Dark Triad Personality Traits, showing a relevant role of Machiavellian-ism in all kinds of investigated sexting behaviors.

Previous work has shown that news media coverage is influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks, and tobacco use. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages, though current news media approaches to describing bullying and cyberbullying remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of news media coverage of bullying and cyberbullying. A sample of newspaper articles covering bullying or cyberbullying across regional and national US newspapers from 6 recent years was identified. A content analysis using natural language processing was conducted with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software program for key variables including affective, social, and cognitive processes. Evaluation included the percentage of words that represented Fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g., epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent Public Health-oriented messages such as prevention. A total of 463 newspaper articles met inclusion criteria, including 140 cyberbullying articles and 323 bullying articles. Findings indicated that cyberbullying articles scored higher on affective processes such as measures of anxiety (Mdn = 0.34) compared to bullying articles (Mdn = 0.22). A greater number of cyberbullying articles were Fear-based (41.4\%) than were bullying articles (19.5\%). An equivalent number of cyberbullying articles (50.0\%) and bullying articles (49.8\%) were Public Health-oriented. Findings may be used to collaborate with journalists toward optimizing prevention-oriented reporting. \textcopyright{} 2019, Society for Prevention Research.}

Accordingly, in this paper, we identify current research on psychological traits and individual differences among computer system users that explain vulnerabilities to cyber security attacks and crimes. Our review shows that computer system users possess different cognitive capabilities which determine their ability to counter information security threats.

This increased time spent online comes with some positive outcomes (e.g., perceptions of increased productivity and connectivity) as well as negative outcomes (e.g., feelings of being overloaded or stressed) for workers and organizations. One of the possible negative outcomes of increased technology use at work is cyberbullying, which involves repeated harassing behaviors that occur using technology and for which there exists a power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator. Whereas there is a growing body of research that has examined cyberbullying among youth, relatively few studies have examined workplace cyberbullying, and no known studies have taken a developmental perspective to examining this phenomenon. Therefore, in this chapter, we review the literature on workplace technology use, with a special focus on age differences in prevalence and usage behaviors. Then, we examine age differences in traditional bullying and cyberbullying at work. Next, we discuss some possible ways in which age may interact with cyberbullying when predicting employee and organizational outcomes. Finally, we outline a number of directions for future research, with a special focus on the role of age. \textcopyright{} 2019 Taylor \& Francis. All rights rerserved.}

There are five basic baseline components - data collection and exploration, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classifier selection and training, and model evaluation, were reviewed. There have been improvements in ML algorithms that were employed for hate speech detection over time. New datasets and different performance metrics have been proposed in the literature. To keep the researchers informed regarding these trends in the automatic detection of hate speech, it calls for a comprehensive and an updated state-of-the-art. The contributions of this study are three-fold. First to equip the readers with the necessary information on the critical steps involved in hate speech detection using ML algorithms. Secondly, the weaknesses and strengths of each method is critically evaluated to guide researchers in the algorithm choice dilemma. Lastly, some research gaps and open challenges were identified. The different variants of ML techniques were reviewed which include classical ML, ensemble approach and deep learning methods.

Social zapping is positively associated with maximizing tendencies and problematic social networks use. However, empirical investigations on which additional personality characteristics predict social-zapping behavior are yet missing. In this study, a sample of N = 190 adults performed a questionnaire-based survey assessing different personality facets and social zapping tendency. Measures included the Dark Triad - Dirty Dozen scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Maximization scale, Pure Procrastination Scale, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) scale, and the Social Zapping Scale. On a bivariate level, social zapping correlated positively with all other measures except for trait FoMO. The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that social zapping was mainly predicted by two dimensions of the Dark Triad, i.e. Machiavellianism and narcissism, as well as attentional impulsivity and the timeliness dimension of procrastination. Based on the results, social zappers can be characterized as individuals who tend to make self-serving and/or impulsive short-sighted decisions at the expense of others. Social zapping is a phenomenon of inherent self-interest, where individuals cancel appointments spontaneously (at the last minute) with others to pursue options they deem best for themselves. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

Our results corroborated the one-factor structure of the Spanish version of the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling (S-GAIT) and replicated online trolling's robust associations with increased psychopathy, sadism, and Machiavellianism. Online trolling also correlated with an elevated use of aggressive and self-defeating humor styles, as well as with heightened expressions of the joy in laughing at others (i.e. katagelasticism) and the joy of being laughed at (i.e., gelotophilia). When applying hierarchical regressions to eliminate the redundancy among these traits, we found that katagelasticism incrementally explained variance ({$\Delta$}R2 = 10.2\%) in online trolling even after accounting for gender and the Dark Tetrad (i.e., male gender and high psychopathy as main predictors: {$\Delta$}R2 = 27.3\%). A subsequent moderation analysis indicated that higher levels of psychopathy was related to a greater engagement in trolling behavior among those high in katagelasticism.

In addition, in large online communities, posts intended to create social interactions among marketers and users are not associated with commercial performance. However, in mid-sized communities, posts with the same intentions increase commercial performance. We theorise that the presence of internet trolls and a lower sense of group loyalty may explain the absence of these associations in large online communities.

Specifically, the players were treated differently based on their group membership whereby low-ranked and young people were likely to be discriminated against in game. Additionally, personal traits such as neuroticism and low agreeableness were significantly positively associated with experienced discrimination, suggesting the role of individual differences in predicting the likelihood of one experiencing discrimination. Encountering online discrimination was further associated with gamers' lowered feelings of belonging to the online community, however no significant effect of discrimination on sociopsychological well-being was found.

Key terms and Boolean operators were used to identifiy English-language papers published in January 1995 to January 2019 in nine databases and Google Scholar databases. Implications for nursing: Despite limited evidence specific to adolescent mothers, contextual studies suggest that social networking sites may enhance well-being. Nurses and midwives need to understand adolescent mothers' use of online networks to aid development of innovative, health-enhancing care strategies using adolescent-familiar modalities.

Since the late 1980s, hijab has attained many meanings, from a symbol of Islamic revivalism to a reconstruction of Malay identity. Today, hijab has become a normative identity of Muslim women in Malaysia. For women who have conformed to this norm, they are expected to be always wearing it and when they decide to de-hijab, the decision can trigger public opprobrium, bullying, and abuse. The de-hijabbing decision of Muslim women in Malaysia has been in the spotlight, particularly for public figures, with media representing the decision as a threat to the Muslim community and Islam in general. However, public scorn, bullying, and abuse have reached an unprecedented level and are increasingly common with the rise of public display of hijab on social media such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Using the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) approach and van Dijk's (1999; 2006) Ideological Square Model, this study examines the positive self and negative other representations evident in the response of netizens to a Malaysian celebrity, Emma Maembong's, de-hijabbing decision. The findings of this research revealed not only the discursive strategies through which an outgroup population is delegitimised in social media, but also contributed to a better understanding of the struggles faced by Muslim women in exercising their agency. \textcopyright{} 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

  abstract = {Cyberbullying at work takes many forms, from aggressive and threatening behavior to social ostracism. It can also have adverse consequences on general well-being that might be even more severe for people whose identities are centrally based on social media ties. We examined this type of identity-driven social media use via the concept of social media identity bubbles. We first analyzed the risk and protective factors associated with cyberbullying victimization at work and then investigated its impacts on well-being. We expected that workers strongly involved in social media identity bubbles would be in the worst position when faced with cyberbullying. Data include a sample of workers from five Finnish expert organizations (N = 563) and a representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1817). We investigated cyberbullying at work with 10 questions adapted from the Cyberbullying Behavior Questionnaire. Other measures included scales for private and professional social media usage, social media identity bubbles (six-item Identity Bubble Reinforcement Scale), well-being at work, sociodemographic factors, and job-related information. Prevalence of monthly cyberbullying victimization at work was 13\% in expert organizations and 17\% in the Finnish working population. Victims were young, active users of professional social media and they were strongly involved in social media identity bubbles. Victims who were in social media identity bubbles reported higher psychological distress, exhaustion, and technostress than other victims. Cyberbullying at work is a prevalent phenomenon and has negative outcomes on well-being at work. Negative consequences are more severe among those with highly identity-driven social media use. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

Accordingly, this study examines mobile social cyberbullying perpetration, a new form of cyberbullying perpetration that is conducted over mobile social media, through the theoretical lenses of Barlett and Gentile Cyberbullying Model (BGCM) and Mobile Technology Acceptance Model (MTAM). The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling analysis was performed on the 489 samples gathered from university students in order to obtain inferential statistics. Perceived anonymity and belief in the irrelevance of muscularity from the BGCM are positively related to mobile usefulness and mobile ease of use from the MTAM, while all of them are reported to have a positive association with the positive cyberbullying attitudes, which ultimately explain mobile social cyberbullying perpetration. From the results, it is ascertained that the well-founded integrated model has made a novel contribution toward the current literature of cyberbullying perpetration, particularly the rarely studied mobile social cyberbullying perpetration. Several suggestions on reducing the mobile social cyberbullying perpetration are then made to the practitioners, especially the government policymakers and mobile social media service providers. \textcopyright{} 2019 International Association for Computer Information Systems.}

The analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package SPSS and the STATA software. The results obtained from the Kruskal\textendash Wallis H test showed significant differences according to these aspects, for both the cybervictim and cyberbully parameters. The results stemming from binary logistic regressions confirmed such differences and regarded those students who belong to the Muslim religion, the gypsy ethnic group and the Asian race as being more likely to become cybervictims. Furthermore, these analyses showed that Gypsy and Asian students were also more likely to be cyberbullies than other groups. The main conclusions state that minority groups are more likely to suffer cyberbullying in intercultural educational environments, and that students from these groups are also more likely to become cyberbullies. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

Four types of celebrity-critiquing cases were selected and discussed. The first research question focused on girls' reactions towards the presented examples. The results indicated that the girls' responses differed depending on the type of case involved. Generally, the teens at first were entertained by the comments about celebrities, but disapproved of cases that seemed to be intended to hurt the celebrity. For all types of cases, however, they were quite judgemental in that they quickly blamed the victim. Although they reported that it is unacceptable to humiliate people online, they were convinced that celebrities should be able to deal with comments, even if they were harsh. The second research question was interested in whether the girls perceived celebrity critiquing as a form of cyberbullying. They said this was not the case, because bullying was considered much more extreme. Moreover, some girls mentioned that to be able to label online commenting as cyberbullying, they would need to know the victim in person and see them suffer. \textcopyright{} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

While existing research mainly concentrated on online peer aggression, some studies pointed to adolescents' aggression toward other targets, such as celebrities. It is known that socio-cognitive characteristics such as empathy and moral disengagement are associated with adolescents' aggression toward peers, but so far it remains unexplored if these traits can also explain celebrity aggression. The current study investigated the relationship between affective and cognitive empathy, moral disengagement and online celebrity aggression. The sample consisted of 1255 adolescents with a mean age of 14.17 years (SD = 0.47). Participants completed the Moral Disengagement Scale adapted to a celebrity context, the Emotional Quotient and a scale measuring mild and severe online celebrity aggression. Structural equation analysis in Mplus indicated that, when controlling for gender and celebrity media consumption, affective empathy was associated with severe and not with mild online celebrity aggression. The cognitive component of empathy was unrelated with online aggression toward celebrities. Moral disengagement was related with mild and severe online celebrity aggression and also mediated the relationship between affective empathy and both mild and severe celebrity aggression. Following these results, strategies aiming at reducing celebrity aggression may benefit from a focus on socio-cognitive characteristics. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd}

In the present study, we investigated the mediating role of materialism in the association between SSR and adolescents' PSU as well as the moderating role of narcissism in the direct and indirect pathways between SSR and PSU. Seven hundred and twelve adolescents completed the measures of SSR, PSU, materialism, and narcissism. The results indicated that SSR was negatively associated with PSU, and materialism mediated this association. In addition, narcissism moderated the association between SSR and materialism and the link between materialism and PSU. Specifically, adolescents with high levels of narcissism are less likely to prioritize materialism when they are in poor SSR, while they are more likely to have a higher level of PSU when they are high in materialism. Altogether, these findings highlight the important roles of materialism and narcissism in the association between SSR and adolescents' PSU. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

A MANOVA showed an overall significant effect of the experimental conditions. On Neuroticism significant differences between all conditions were found with targets rated highest and the control lowest. In terms of Extroversion the target was rated as lower than the control and the bully. No main effect was found for Openness. On Agreeableness the bully was rated as lower than both the target and the control. The bully was rated lower on Conscientiousness than the control. The significant differences reflected medium to large effect sizes. By and large the results are in agreement with comparable self-report data.

The analysis presented here, carried out through a questionnaire distributed online and filled in by 655 Italian high school students, allowed to highlight the relationships between these variables. In particular, it emerged that the phenomena of cyberbullying and cybervictimisation are related to the time spent online and to the mechanisms of moral disengagement, which in turn are related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Emotions experienced are most clearly positive in cases of cyberbullying and negative for the victims. This correspondence, however, is reversed in bullies who resort more to thoughts aimed at moral disengagement and feel more negative emotions. The same reversal seems to occur in the victims who, in correspondence with an increased use of the mechanisms of moral disengagement, report to feel more positive emotions. \textcopyright{} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.}

To build a four-factor measure, we modified and extended the Short Dark Triad (SD3) measure to include sadism. A series of three studies yielded the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4), a four subscale inventory with 7 items per construct. Study 1 (N = 868) applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to a diverse 48-item pool using data collected on MTurk. A 4-factor solution revealed a separate sadism factor, as well as a shifted Dark Triad. Study 2 (N =999 students) applied EFA to a reduced 37-item set. Associations with adjustment and sex drive provided insight into unique personality dynamics of the four constructs. In Study 3 (N = 660), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the final 28 items showed acceptable fit for a four-factor solution. Moreover, the resulting 7-item subscales each showed coherent links with the Big Five and adjustment. In sum, the fourfactor structure replicated across student and community samples. Although they overlap to a moderate degree, the four subscales show distinctive correlates-even with a control for acquiescence. We also uncovered a novel link between sadism and sexuality, but no association with maladjustment. \textcopyright{} 2021 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH. All rights reserved.}

To address this, we conducted a survey (N = 147) among undergraduate students living in the US to identify the association between the three Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) and six computer-mediated communication outcomes (e.g., compulsive Internet behavior, opinion leadership, perceived anonymity, media trust, social media self-presentation, and psychological reactance). We also examine gender as a potential moderator.

This is a contemporary issue with different consequences from in-person IPV. C-IPV is a complex phenomenon triggered by a number of factors, including personality traits such as the Dark Tetrad, composed of four ``malevolent'' qualities: subclinical narcissism, Machiavellianism, subclinical psychopathy, and everyday sadism. The Dark Tetrad plays an important role in predicting the perpetration or victimization of the resulting pervasive behaviors. Although the correlations between in-person IPV and the Dark Tetrad have been studied before, to our knowledge this investigation is the first to look at the links between these four dark personality traits and C-IPV. With a sample of 1,189 participants, we measured C-IPV victimization and perpetration rates and compared the results with the Dark Tetrad profiles of the respondents. To analyze these correlations, we conducted bivariate analysis and structural equation modeling. The analysis yielded positive relations of psychopathy and narcissism with cyber controlling behaviors. Psychopathy was found to be strongly related with direct cyber aggression behaviors; sadism was mainly related with C-IPV victimization in both controlling and direct aggression, and, finally and interestingly, Machiavellianism presented negative correlations with direct cyber aggression. Remarkable is that joining sadistic personalities increased vulnerability to victimization from C-IPV direct aggression, as well as more psychopathic traits and an increased probability of perpetration. These combinations may create dangerous situations. In conclusion, we found that both C-IPV perpetrators and victims present higher scores in the dark personality traits and gender-based differences than in-person IPV actors. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.}

  abstract = {New means of communication have made it easier to communicate worldwide. They enable contact in real time, irrespective of distance and borders. However, these new means of communication have been diverted from their primary use to feed deviant fantasies or to satisfy a need of superiority. There are particular situations that can directly affect people: child pornography, grooming and cyber-bullying. The Internet is the main tool that is used in these three situations. However, the extensive use of cell phones should not be overlooked. In all three situations, the essential factors that explain the growth of offences are virtual aspects of communication and anonymity. Apart from child pornography, the main victims of cyber-grooming and cyber-bullying are adolescents, as, by definition, the victim must be able to establish virtual contact with an aggressor and thus have the capacity to master telecommunication tools. Likewise, the appeal of these tools for adolescents inevitably leads to their deviant use by other young people who are not always aware of the danger of virtual contacts and do not always recognize the impact of bullying. Criminal and victim profiles have been identified. Dematerialized aspect of these offences makes it difficult to apprehend the perpetrators. States must take steps to deal with cyber-criminality. New methods need to be set up to apprehend the perpetrators and protect the victims. \textcopyright{} 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the collective impact of awareness and knowledge about fake news, attitudes toward news verification, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, fear of missing out (FoMO) and sadism on social media users' intention to verify news before sharing on social media. Design/methodology/approach: The current study's conceptual framework is developed by a comprehensive literature review on social networking and the theory of planned behavior. The data for samples were collected from 400 respondents in India to test the conceptual framework using the partial least square\textendash structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The results show that awareness and knowledge, perceived behavioral control, attitudes toward news verification and FoMO are significant predictors of intention to verify news before sharing. Research limitations/implications: The present study concludes implications for managers of social media companies and policy actors that want to take steps toward arresting the spread of fake news via social media. Originality/value: Academic investigation on fake news sharing on social media has recently gained traction. The current work is unique because it uses the theory of planned behavior as a basis for predicting social media user's intention to verify news before sharing on social media. \textcopyright{} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.}

  abstract = {Investigations of women's same-sex relationships present a paradoxical pattern, with women generally disliking competition, yet also exhibiting signs of intrasexual rivalry. The current article leverages the historical challenges faced by female ancestors to understand modern women's same-sex relationships. Across history, women were largely denied independent access to resources, often depending on male partners' provisioning to support themselves and their children. Same-sex peers thus became women's primary romantic rivals in competing to attract and retain relationships with the limited partners able and willing to invest. Modern women show signs of this competition, disliking and aggressing against those who threaten their romantic prospects, targeting especially physically attractive and sexually uninhibited peers. However, women also rely on one another for aid, information, and support. As most social groups were patrilocal across history, upon marriage, women left their families to reside with their husbands. Female ancestors likely used reciprocal altruism or mutualism to facilitate cooperative relationships with nearby unrelated women. To sustain these mutually beneficial cooperative exchange relationships, women may avoid competitive and status-striving peers, instead preferring kind, humble, and loyal allies. Ancestral women who managed to simultaneously compete for romantic partners while forming cooperative female friendships would have been especially successful. Women may therefore have developed strategies to achieve both competitive and cooperative goals, such as guising their intrasexual competition as prosociality or vulnerability. These historical challenges make sense of the seemingly paradoxical pattern of female aversion to competition, relational aggression, and valuation of loyal friends, offering insight into possible opportunities for intervention. \textcopyright{} 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

These constructs tend to be compared or used interchangeably, but several previous studies have emphasized that this multiplurality of constructs could contribute to the existence of constraints in the interpretation and comparison of results between studies. To address these constraints, we undertook a systematic review with the aims of (1) identifying scientific constructs related to intimate abuse through technology and (2) identifying behavioral dimensions developed to analyze this phenomenon. In our review, we included 126 studies and identified 42 constructs and 20 multidimensional behavioral sets related to intimate abuse through technology. On the basis of our analysis, we recommend that future studies adopt the construct of digital dating abuse or the initial theoretical formulation of cyber dating abuse to analyze this phenomenon since they both provide formal definitions and full-spectrum behavioral dimensions; however, these constructs also present some limitations. We also recommend that future studies consider expanding this research field to different configurations of intimate relationships, considering the inclusion of more diverse age groups. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd}

Databases were searched for published empirical studies examining the relationship between body image and eating concerns and Internet use. Our search identified 67 studies. The findings indicate the presence of appearance-related content on Internet and social media, including content promoting extreme body shapes or behaviors. The results from qualitative, correlational and experimental studies overall support the relationship between Internet use and body image and eating concerns. The studies identified were grounded in three main theoretical frameworks: sociocultural, objectification theory, and social identity theory; however, other more minor frameworks were also used. The use of Internet, and particularly appearance-focused social media, is associated with heightened body image and eating concerns. Developmental characteristics may make adolescents particularly vulnerable to these effects. \textcopyright{} 2015, Springer International Publishing.}

Methods: Participants were 993 Spanish students of Secondary Education, 535 girls and 458 boys with mean age 15.75 (SD = 1.47). Of the total sample, 70.3\% (n = 696) had or had had a partner. Results: Boys perform more sexting, consume more pornographic content, and have more hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes than girls. However, girls perpetrate more IPCS than boys. The results of the hierarchical multiple regression indicate that hostile sexism is a predictor of IPCS, as well as the combined effect of Gender \texttimes{} Pornography and Benevolent Sexism \texttimes{} Sexting. Conclusions: it is essential to implement sexual affective education programs in schools in which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are incorporated so that boys and girls can experience their relationships, both offline and online, in an egalitarian and violence-free way. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The mass creations of digital textual data raised the intentions of scholars to study the hidden abstractions of personality by applying automatic personality detection approaches. Most of the current automatic personality detection studies focused on Big 5 personality model as a framework to study the underlying characteristics of human. As such, this study incorporates the Three Factor Personality (PEN) Model as a personality framework to guide our understanding and revealing the role of words in depicting the characteristics of a user. This preliminary study revealed how the sentiment perceptions of public towards specific words could assist us in detecting the personality of Facebook users by exploiting their status messages. As the first phase of our study, this experiment focuses on gathering the general perceptions of Malaysians towards 52 English words and 17 interjections that was retrieve from the domain stated above. A Likert scale questionnaire executed to find the sentiment valences of 67 words through analyzing responses from participants and statistical significance will assist the categorization of words under PEN traits. The evaluation provides the necessary analysis that could assist our main research that focuses on automatic personality detections specifically on the psychoticism trait. Our initial findings has highlighted that the five words categorized under psychoticism has strong Cronbach's Alpha coefficients and significant effect from multivariate analysis that indirectly affirmed the reliability of the categorization of the words. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.}

The instruments used were an ad hoc questionnaire for socioeconomic variables and bullying behaviour, an empathy questionnaire, and a personality questionnaire. Victims yielded higher scores in terms of empathic concern, while both groups, aggressors and victims, yielded similar results in terms of cognitive and affective empathy. Concerning the correlation between these variables and personality, anxiety was found to be correlated with affective empathy and empathetic concern in both groups. A correlation between cognitive empathy and impulsiveness and activity was also found in both groups. Remarkably, aggression and cognitive empathy were found to be correlated, but only among victims. Finally, experiences with classmates, anxiety, sincerity, and aggression were found to act as predictors of school bullying, while gender and aggression factors were found to act as predictors among perpetrators, but to a lesser extent, which suggests that other factors must be in place for bullying behaviour to occur. The results suggest that, although empathy levels are different in both groups, they cannot act as a predictor of bullying, especially concerning perpetrators. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The latter examines how abuse is accomplished, treated, and negotiated in specific online settings. A central advantage of doing so is that the specifics and details of instances of abuse become amenable to examination and consequently allow for identification of in situ means by which abuse maybe challenged. In taking this approach, online abuse is examined for how it is produced and situated in specific social and interactional settings. \textcopyright{} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd}

  abstract = {Sexual cyberbullying is becoming a serious problem in today's society. In the workplace, this issue is more complex because of the power imbalance between potential perpetrators and victims. Preventing sexual cyberbullying in organizations is very important for a safety and respectful workplace. Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards establish certain policies to be considered to create an organizational culture based on zero tolerance to sexual cyberbullying. The research aims to broaden knowledge about personality and sexual cyberbullying. Therefore, this paper proposes a crucial tool to explore potential sexual cyberbullying behaviour. This study analysed how personality traits, particularly those related to the Dark Triad (psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism), might influence this behaviour. Participants (N = 374) were Spanish young adults, using the convenience sampling to recruit them. The methodology focused on the use of structural equation modelling and ensemble classification tree. First, we tested the proposed hypotheses with structural equation method based on covariance using the Lavaan R-package. Second, for the ensemble of classification trees, we applied the package randomForest and Adabag (bagging and boosting) in R. Results proposed high levels of psychopathy and Machiavellianism are more likely to be related to sexual cyberbullying behaviours. Organizations could use the tool proposed in this research to develop internal policies and procedures for detection and deterrence of potential cyberbullying behaviours. By raising awareness about cyberbullying behaviour including its conceptualisation and measurement in training courses, organizations might build an organizational culture based on a respectful workplace without sexual cyberbullying behaviours.

The big data from cyber-physical systems and social media platforms can be used for predictive policing to identify potential criminal activities, abuse, offenders, and victims of abuse. This study offers a systematic literature review on the use of soft computing techniques for abuse detection in the complex cyber\textendash physical\textendash social big data systems in cognitive smart cities. The objective is to define and identify the diverse concept of abuse and systematize techniques for automatic abuse detection for cyber abuse detection on social media and real-time abuse detection using IoT. The cyber abuse studies on social media platforms have further been categorized as cyber-hate and cyberbullying whereas the real-time abuse includes studies using Internet of cyber-physical systems. As in a cognitive smart city, citizens expect more from their urban environments with minimal intervention, this study helps to establish the need to capture situational context and awareness in real-time and foster the need to develop a proactive as well as reactive safety mechanism to mitigate the risks of online abuse. The need of the hour is to entrench self-learning, thinking and understanding capabilities into the physical and social world for reinforcing intelligent mechanisms which can detect assaults and disorderly conduct. \textcopyright{} 2021 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

It is known that PSMU is negatively associated with social connectedness. The present study examined the role of family life satisfaction in this relationship by investigating its mediating and moderating role in the relationship between problematic social use and social connectedness. The present study comprised 549 adolescents (296 girls and 253 boys) who had used social media for at least 1 year and had at least one social media account. The measures used included the Social Media Disorder Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, and Family Life Satisfaction Scale. Mediation and moderation analyses were performed using Hayes's Process program. Regression analysis showed that PSMU negatively predicted family life satisfaction and social connectedness. In addition, family life satisfaction and PSMU predicted social connectedness. Mediation analysis showed that family life satisfaction had a significant mediation effect in the relationship between PSMU and social connectedness. Family life satisfaction was partially mediated in the relationship between PSMU and social connectedness. Moderation analysis showed that family life satisfaction did not have a significant effect on the relationship between PSMU and social connectedness. The study suggests that family life satisfaction is a meaningful mediator (but not a moderator) in the relationship between problematic social media use and social connectedness. \textcopyright{} 2020, The Author(s).}

Programmers can help one another by uploading code samples to such a forum. Unfortunately, finding relevant code samples can prove difficult using existing search engines for large, diverse forums. Therefore, we have prototyped a new kind of code search engine for online forums that draws upon unsupervised machine learning in two ways. First, it displays code samples in visual groupings based on the mutual similarity of code samples. Second, it uses the assignment of code samples to clusters to achieve a form of query expansion, thereby identifying additional search results as potentially useful. We evaluated the system by running it on the forum for the LabVIEW programming language. A textual analysis of posts showed that the unsupervised machine learning algorithm successfully tended to assign code samples to clusters based on topical similarity. An empirical user evaluation confirmed that the new search engine improved on the forum's existing search engine by providing results for more queries, by generating more results per query, and by providing more relevant search results. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.}

  abstract = {The present research is aimed at clarifying meta-analytically the relation of so-called Dark Triad (DT; i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, or psychopathy) traits to factor analytic models covering the basic personality space. Unlike recent meta-analyses that investigated such relations at the bivariate level, we used 2-stage structural equation modeling (TSSEM) meta-analysis to explore the full complexity of structural relations between DT traits and the five-factor model (FFM) and HEXACO dimensions, as well as the higher-order personality factors labeled Alpha (or stability) and Beta (or plasticity). Based on pooled matrices, covering k = 108 samples with a total N of 40,818, our findings point to the following major conclusions: (a) common elements among DT traits constitute a higher-order factor D that is not covered by Alpha and Beta; (b) no common general factor underlies all 3 higher-order traits; (c) at the dimension level of DT and the FFM, there are cross-loadings from D onto agreeableness and conscientiousness, as well as from Beta onto narcissism; (d) after adding HEXACO dimensions, the higher-order structure remains basically intact, but the low pole of HEXACO honesty-humility becomes an integral part of higher-order D; and (e) moderator analyses of different DT measures largely reveal structural equivalence of original measures of single DT traits with the Short Dark Triad, but less so with the Dirty Dozen DT measure. Overall, the results appear to converge on a coherent picture of several pieces of information on the structure of ``dark'' and ``bright'' personality that were previously discussed in a piecemeal fashion.

Next, research on the correlates, mediators, and moderators of workplace cyberbullying is summarized, with a focus on person-related and work-related variables such as mental health, physical health, perceptions of the job (e.g., job satisfaction), job-related behaviors (e.g., intentions to quit), and coping strategies. Then, recently validated measures of workplace cyberbullying are described, providing researchers with guidance on questionnaires to use in future studies of workplace cyberbullying. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future research directions and practical applications, with an eye toward the development and evaluation of effective workplace cyberbullying interventions. \textcopyright{} 2019 Taylor \& Francis.

While such abusive acts are known to cause severe consequences in the general population little is known about how celebrity abuse is perceived by observers. This study investigated observers' impressions of the severity of online abuse on Twitter, the blame attributed to celebrities for the abuse they received, and the role of the dark triad of observers' personality factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) in these decisions. We manipulated celebrity tweet content (negative, neutral, positive) and the volume of abusive comments (high, low) the tweets received. Celebrities received more blame the more negative their initial tweet was, and incidents were perceived as least severe following a negative tweet with a high volume of abuse. Observer impressions were influenced by their dark triad personality factors. Following negative tweets, as observer narcissism increased, victim blame increased and perceived severity decreased. Following positive tweets, as observer psychopathy increased, perceived severity decreased. Results are discussed in the context of the Warranting Theory of online impression formation and the ramifications for celebrity social media use are explored. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

Machiavellianism and narcissism were directly associated with FoMO. In the fully mediated model, narcissism (but not Machiavellianism) was still associated with FoMO, and in turn, FoMO was related to PSU. Although preliminary, the results of the present study indicated that Machiavellianism and narcissism might represent antecedents of FoMO, in addition to the Big Five personality traits, and both could be involved in the development of PSU. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The current study sought to explore and extend the personality profile of Internet trolls.

A sample of 415 participants (36\% men, 63\% women, 1\% other) with a mean age of 23.37 years (SD = 7.19) completed an online questionnaire. Results showed that men were more likely than women to engage in trolling, and higher levels of trait psychopathy and sadism predicted trolling behaviour. Lower levels of affective empathy predicted perpetration of trolling, and trait psychopathy moderated the association between cognitive empathy and trolling. Results indicate that when high on trait psychopathy, trolls employ an empathic strategy of predicting and recognising the emotional suffering of their victims, while abstaining from the experience of these negative emotions. Thus, trolls appear to be master manipulators of both cyber-settings and their victims' emotions. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

Since the higher education necessitates access to information technology, university students are found comparatively more exposed and involved in the incidences of cyberbullying. Prior research has heavily focused on school students and has mostly ignored university students. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a systematic review of literature targeting university students specifically to understand the underlying causes that give rise to the problem of cyberbullying within the university environment so that the issue could be adequately addressed. In this attempt, this study observed 32 studies out of a total of 7,939 reviews searched for the purpose. This study reviews a multitude of factors such as the role of an individual's personal, socio-cognitive, psychological and environmental factors towards cyberbullying and provides a 360-degree view of the factors contributing to cyberbullying behaviour instead of the traditional approach of focusing on one or two factors. This study will not only enrich the understanding of potential cyberbullying factors that drive university students towards notorious cyberbullying behaviour but also provides valuable insights to researchers, policy-makers, educators, universities, governments and parents. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.}

  abstract = {Higher education requires access to Information and communication technologies (ICT's). This exposure and access to ICT, coupled with the excessive usage of social media, has augmented the problem of cyberbullying among university students. Previous studies have investigated cyberbullying among school students while overlooking university students, who are actually more engaged in cyberbullying perpetration. In view of the gravity of the situation and its impact on the wellbeing of the university students, this study aims to understand the role of personal and psychological factors dragging Malaysian undergraduate students of public and private universities towards cyberbullying behaviour. In order to develop the framework, the study has utilized the 'Theory of planned behavior' and 'Social Cognitive Theory'. The study is based on a quantitative research approach and employs a self-administered survey to collect data. The data has been analyzed through the Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) technique using SmartPLS. The results reveal that individual factors including cyberbullying awareness and personality traits are not associated with Malaysian undergraduate students' cyberbullying behaviour. However, psychological factors, including self-esteem, internalizing behavior, and anti-social behavior, play an instrumental role in developing Malaysian undergraduate students' cyberbullying attitude. The study also confirms that subjective norms assert a powerful positive impact on cyberbullying attitude of Malaysian undergraduates. Lastly, the study aims to contribute to the research on cyberbullying behavior by offering a conceptual validated model that predicts Malaysian university students' cyberbullying behavior. This study also found that social media usage plays moderating role between cyberbullying intention and cyberbullying behavior. Parents, universities, and governments will benefit from this study by understanding factors to be considered when making a policy to reduce cyberbullying among university students. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.}

This is because they help overcome physical limitations and save time and energy by doing everything online. The rapid growth in this tendency has created the need for extra protection, by creating new rules and policies. However, sometimes users interrupt these rules and policies through unethical behavior. For example, bullying on social media platforms is a type of cyber victimization that can cause serious harm to individuals, leading to suicide. A firm step towards protecting the cyber society from victimization is to detect the topics that trigger the feeling of being a victim. In this paper, the focus is on Twitter, but it can be expanded to other platforms. The proposed method discovers cyber victimization by detecting the type of behavior leading to them being a victim. It consists of a text classification model, that is trained with a collected dataset of the official news since 2000, about suicide, self-harm, and cyberbullying. Results show that LinearSVC performs slightly better with an accuracy of 96\%. \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}

In particular, correlations have been studied leading to effective characterization of people's behavior, and the model has become notorious for its role in the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal surrounding the 2016 US presidential elections. In this paper, we develop Big-2 (or ROSe, for Relationship to Others and to Self), a model via which the personality of users of online platforms can be studied using a lightweight set of markers focused on online behavior, avoiding the major data privacy pitfalls afflicting approaches based on more powerful models that characterize personal aspects of the human psyche. Evaluation of Big-2's effectiveness is done in two parts: a quantitative evaluation on a specific prediction task and a qualitative one based on an analysis of the different ways in which the Big-2 traits can be derived from online behavior, proposing a general template to guide such efforts. Quantitative results show that our lightweight model can match or surpass the performance of Big-5 in a prediction task, while qualitative results show that it is feasible to implement the model based on the observation of basic online user behavior. Our main result is a general-purpose model that can be used to characterize the personality traits of users of online platforms in an ethical manner. Our proposed model provides a valuable tool to carry out effective and explainable analyses of online personality, avoiding the collection of unnecessary user data that would open the possibility for ethical violations. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

  abstract = {Social Media has become an integral part of our daily life. Not only it enables collaboration and flow of information but has also become an imperative tool for businesses and governments around the world. All this makes a compelling case for everyone to be on some sort of online social media platform. However, this virtuousness is overshadowed by some of its shortcomings. The manifestation of antisocial behaviour online is a growing concern that hinders participation and cultivates numerous social problems. Antisocial behaviour exists in its various forms such as aggression, disregard for safety, lack of remorse, unlawful behaviour, etc. The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to detect and classify online antisocial behaviour (ASB). The automatic content classification addresses the issue of scalability, which is imperative when dealing with online platforms. A benchmark dataset was created with multi-class annotation under the supervision of a domain expert. Extensive experiments were conducted with multiple deep learning algorithms and their superior results were validated against the results from the traditional machine learning algorithms. Visually enhanced interpretation of the classification process is presented for model and error analyses. Accuracy of up to 99\% in class identification was achieved on the ground truth dataset for empirical validation. The study is an evidence of how the cutting-edge deep learning technology can be utilized to solve a real-world problem of curtailing antisocial behaviour, which is a public health threat and a social problem. \textcopyright{} This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Cyber-criminals aim to manipulate vulnerable areas in cyberspace by playing on human understanding and making a profit. They threaten minors, especially adolescents, who are not adequately overseen while online. To address this issue, there is an urgent need for a robust content-based cybercrime detection framework. The aim of this research work is to explore possible combinations of various preprocessing, feature selection and classification methodologies using the cuckoo search metaheuristic approach. This approach seeks to improve the performance of content-based cybercrime detection system. For the purpose of this research, four publicly available datasets for cyberbullying detection have been utilized for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was then further compared with three recent cyberbullying detection models based on various evaluation parameters. These parameters included precision, recall and f-measure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach outperformed other recent techniques on all the datasets, giving high predictive recall value via tenfold cross-validation. \textcopyright{} 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum \& Minerals.}

A questionnaire survey was conducted among 693 Chinese college students. Based on the findings, we constructed two competing models (mediated moderation and moderated mediation). The results revealed the following: (1) Aggressive traits and beliefs about aggression were all positively correlated with cyberbullying, aggressive traits were positively correlated with beliefs about aggression, and aggressive traits were negatively correlated with network public opinion. (2) The effect of aggressive traits on beliefs about aggression and cyberbullying was moderated by network public opinion. When network public opinion included irrational comments, aggressive traits directly and indirectly affected cyberbullying. When network public opinion included rational comments, aggressive traits only directly affected cyberbullying. Finally, (3) the effect of aggressive traits on cyberbullying was moderated by network public opinion and the moderating effect of network public opinion was partly realized through the mediating effect of beliefs about aggression. The findings contribute to our understanding of when and how aggressive traits affect cyberbullying. We found support for the mediated moderation model, and the results have implications for prevention and intervention in cyberbullying. \textcopyright{} 2019}

  abstract = {Despite growing prevalence of derogatory online behaviors, still little is known about psychological factors underlying this negative phenomenon. In the present study, we aimed to compare characteristics of persons who post hating and non-hating comments about Polish sports players during Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang (2018) on the Internet. Ninety-four Internet users (41\% women) participated in the study, among which 46 posted hating comments. After 1 month, participants were invited to take part in a psychological survey, and filled the Dark Triad questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Scale of Frustration, and the Scale of Envy. Results showed that high scores in Psychopathy subscale were significant predictors of posting hating comments online; high scores on the Envy Scale were marginally significant. Our findings provide initial evidence that persons who engage in derogatory online behavior have a high level of Psychopathy, but, contrary to previous studies, do not have elevated levels of other traits, commonly associated with disruptive behavior. Our research is one of the first to establish a psychological background of online haters, while setting a clear line between online hating and other derogatory online behaviors (e.g., trolling, cyber-bullying, or hatred speech). \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Sorokowski, Kowal, Zdybek and Oleszkiewicz.}

  abstract = {The Dark Triad of personality \textendash{} Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy \textendash{} has been shown to influence a variety of behaviours. Typically, high levels of these traits predict engaging in behaviour at the periphery of what is considered socially normative. Such individuals do not display clinical maladaptation however, and function relatively normally. The Dark Triad's influence extends to the online context, where it predicts questionable behaviour when using social media such as Facebook. For example it can affect the content of users' status updates, or what media they post. In this paper we examine a new concept known as Facebook surveillance. This details the deliberate examination of users' profiles in order to gather information for one's own advantage. We suggest this is distinct with the conventional viewing of ones ``feed'' (which has little intent), or the stalking of ex-romantic partners (which has a emotive component). We predicted that Machiavellianism and psychopathy would both predict Facebook surveillance, whereas narcissism would not. Furthermore, we postulated that the Machiavellianism-surveillance relationship would be mediated by endorsement of gossip, whereas for psychopathy it would be mediated by intolerance for uncertainty. 259 participants took part in an online survey to measure these traits. Results supported our hypotheses, and suggested two forms of surveillance \textendash{} Facebook tracking, which was more recreational, and Facebook investigating, which was more deliberate and targeted. Future studies are then discussed which may use more complex measures of narcissism, and gather behavioural and/or qualitative measures of surveillance. \textcopyright{} 2019}

Cyberbullying is a harmful online behavior that is difficult to predict and prevent. To address this issue, this study examines offline aggression and online aggression (cybertrolling behavior) and the consistencies or discrepancies between offline and online self-presentation of aggressive individuals. It aimed to determine whether or not general aggression is a good predictor of cybertrolling behavior. An online survey for adults (N = 531) showed a significant relationship between aggression and cybertrolling behavior, suggesting aggressive individuals offline are aggressive individuals online. Regression analysis showed that offline aggression can be a good predictor of cybertrolling behavior. However, the results also showed that there are inconsistencies between offline and online self-presentation for individuals who show higher levels of aggression. This study highlights the important role aggression can play in how one presents the self online. \textcopyright{} 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.}

However, males and females may differ with respect to specific patterns and types of internet usage and related IA. To investigate further, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate gender-related differences in internet gaming disorder (IGD) and social media addiction (SMA). The current meta-analysis aimed to quantify gender-related effect sizes relating to IGD and SMA, examine potential moderating influences of regions and other possible confounds, and compare the findings with generalized IA at the country level. The meta-analysis comprised 53 effect sizes with 82,440 individuals from 21 countries/regions for IGD, and 41 effect sizes with 58,336 individuals from 22 countries/regions for SMA. A random-effects model confirmed important gender-specific distinctions as men were more likely to exhibit IGD than women (g = 0.479) and less likely to exhibit SMA than women (g = -0.202). Additional moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes of IGD and SMA were larger in Europe and the Americas than in Asia. Further analyses indicated that the effect sizes of gender-related differences in IGD and SMA at the country-level were significantly larger than those in generalized IA, which suggests that gender-related differences in specific IAs may be underestimated in the ``umbrella'' of generalized IA. Results have implications for explaining why males and females may become addicted to internet use through different pathways. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

Using a stratified cluster random sampling method, 626 college students were tested. Structural equation modeling was used for multiple mediation analysis. Results: (1) The positive rate of childhood psychological maltreatment, referring to sustained and repeated experiencing at least one kind of psychological maltreatment, was reported by accounted for 33.87\% of participants; (2) a significant positive correlation existed between childhood psychological maltreatment, immorality, and cyberbullying perpetration attitudes. However, these variables were negatively correlated with empathy (cognitive and affective empathy); and (3) there were three mediating paths: childhood psychological maltreatment was linked to cyberbullying perpetration attitudes of male college students through the mediating roles of cognitive empathy and immorality and the chain-mediating role of cognitive empathy and immorality. Conclusions: Greater experience of childhood psychological maltreatment predicted more favorable attitudes toward cyberbullying perpetration among male college students, mediated by cognitive empathy and immorality. These findings may assist parents and educators by providing effective intervention for cyberbullying perpetration attitudes. \textcopyright{} 2020 Sun et al.

Automated cyberbullying detection methods can help prevent cyberbullying before the harm is done on the victim. In this study, we analyze a corpus of cyberbullying Tweets to construct an automated detection model. Our method emphasizes on the two claims that are supported by our results. First, despite other approaches that assume that cyberbullying instances use vulgar or profane words, we show that they do not necessarily contain negative words.

  abstract = {The intense proliferation of social media platforms into every facet of human lives has engaged researchers' attention towards understanding their adverse influences, referred to as the dark side of social media (DoSM) in the evolving literature. A relatively unexplored context in this regard is employees' personal use of social media during work hours and its impact on work-related outcomes. Since using social media during work hours can have implications for work performance and productivity, the lack of research in the area needs to be addressed by scholars sooner rather than later. Specifically, it is important to understand the drivers and outcomes of such behaviour. We have thus conceptualized a theoretical model based on the associations among individual tendencies (exhibitionism and voyeurism), fear of missing out (FoMO), and individual-level psychological (compulsive use of social media) and behavioral (work performance decrement and procrastination) outcomes of social media use during work hours. Grounded in the stressor-strain-outcomes (SSO) framework, the hypothesized associations were tested by a path analysis of 312 responses collected from individuals working in the United States. The results confirmed significant relationships between individual tendencies and FoMO, as well as psychological and behavioural outcomes. The findings contribute to the evolving literature around DoSM in the workplace and offer useful and practical insights. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors}

Accordingly, the complex interrelationships among these phenomena have remained understudied, creating a chasm that hinders a clearer understanding of their drivers and the potential counterstrategies to mitigate the collateral damage they may cause. We attempt to bridge this gap by drawing upon the theory of social comparison and the theory of compensatory internet use to formulate a framework that hypothesizes the mechanism of interaction among these negative fallouts. The model, tested through analysis of data collected from 321 social media users from the United Kingdom (UK), takes into consideration the moderation effect of the frequency of posting social media status updates and social media envy, along with the mediation effect of social comparison and stalking. The results indicate that FoMO and social comparison are directly associated with fatigue. Furthermore, social comparison partially mediates the association of FoMO and fatigue, while social media envy negatively moderates the association of FoMO with social comparison. The results provide new insights into the dynamic interplay of these dark side manifestations of social media. \textcopyright{} 2021}

Although many studies have examined various personality traits or motivations as predictors in isolation, fewer studies have investigated the mediations between personality traits and motivations. Furthermore, the analyzed personality traits have been limited to a few core concepts, with the Big Five personality traits being a standard model in this context. However, more recently the dark triad of personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) has been found to be associated with various forms of problematic online behavior and usage, such as online gambling, yet little is known about gaming disorder. The current study examines the relationship of these dark personality traits to gaming disorder with three gaming motivations (achievement, social, and escapism) as mediators. Method: The study uses an online survey of 1,502 German digital game users. Results: Results indicate a fully mediated association for narcissism via escapism and partial mediation associations for Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Direct effects on gaming disorder were observed for Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Indirect effects by psychopathy were observed via escapism and social motivation, by narcissism via escapism, and by Machiavellianism via social motivation. Discussion and conclusions: These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the mediation of gaming motivations and the dark triad personality traits' importance for gaming disorder. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s).}

The participants were a convenience sample of 598 cyber bully-victims who were Turkish university students (229 females, 362 males, and seven unknown). The findings empirically supported UGT for conceptualization of cyberbullying perpetration. Almost half of the participants (49.7\%) cyberbullied someone twice or more during the preceding 6 months, and males cyberbullied others significantly more than females. In terms of the structural interrelationships, (a) online disinhibition was the only personality trait related to cyberbullying others for entertainment; (b) moral disengagement and aggression were the two variables associated with the revenge motive of cyberbullying perpetration; (c) although online disinhibition was negatively related to cyberbullying others for harm, moral disengagement and aggression were positively linked to harm; and (d) moral disengagement and narcissism were the two personality trait variables associated with the dominance motive of cyberbullying perpetration. Results imply that UGT offers a new understanding about cyberbullying perpetration to researchers, theorists, and practitioners. Personality traits play an important role in cyberbullying perpetration motives and behaviors. Thus, personality traits should be considered in prevention and intervention efforts against cyberbullying. The earlier the personality characteristics of the young individuals are identified, the earlier they can be prevented from engaging in cyberbullying perpetration. Also, sports activities, social events, competitive contests, or leisure and recreational activities offered by university managements can help the university youth to keep away from cyberbullying perpetration and to satisfy motives in more appropriate ways. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2019.}

We hypothesized those who were higher on the D4 and RWA would show more sympathy towards SSE. We also investigated if cognitive suppression use could predict more support for SSE scenarios. In a cross-sectional design with vignettes, participants indicated their level of agreement with four real-world examples of SSE. A total of 398 participants (287 women, 103 men, 6 non-binary, and 2 who did not indicate gender) from 43 countries were recruited online. We ran a series of hierarchical regressions to develop predictive models to test our hypotheses. Being higher on RWA was a significant predictor that explained the most variance in nearly all models. Being higher on the D4 also predicted more support for SSE in select circumstances. Our findings contribute to the understanding of dispositional dynamics and interpersonal differences in the legitimization of SSE. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s).

An anonymous online study, comprising questionnaires and a short picture-based induction procedure was completed by 323 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition by the hosting software, Qualtrics. Analysis showed that increased sadistic interest was reported by those in the experimental condition who had higher levels of baseline sadism.

The present study comprised part of a qualitative needs assessment investigation with the use of focus groups and individual interviews among key stakeholder groups assessing perceived impacts with a focus on the negative consequences and perceived harms.

Data were analysed with thematic analysis. Findings focused primarily on social media use impacts and indicated that processes underlying impacts experienced by adolescents may be conceptualized on a severity continuum. Stakeholder consensus on perceptions of challenges and perceived harms formed the second theme, with impacts further analysed as relating to time displacement, peer judgement, sensory overload and context of the adolescent with functional (performance, task switching, use of multiple devices), cognitive (loss or deterioration of attentional focus, attention deficit), and emotional consequences (stress, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive/checking behaviours). A third theme formed was individual vulnerabilities predisposing poor mental health outcomes. The final theme related to impacts dependent on context and meaning attached. Findings suggest a consideration of a spectrum approach encompassing a broader range of potential psychological challenges and perceived harms beyond safety concerns and addiction in understanding problematic adolescent online experiences. Understanding perceived harms can aid the objective setting of interventions and consideration of mental health literacy in school curricula. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Considered by many to be a "dark" personality trait, narcissism likely occupies a central position in the dark personality nomological net. The present chapter provides an overview of research findings and challenges involving the Dark Triad traits: narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. Possible "fourth" traits that may comprise a Dark Tetrad-greed, spite, and sadism-are also discussed, especially in relation to narcissism. This chapter also discusses dark personality trait assessment, general differences and similarities between narcissism and the abovementioned dark personality traits, and current research findings on the Dark Triad and Dark Tetrad. Key issues and controversies regarding the factor structure of the Dark Triad and the efficacy of its expansion to include other dark traits (e.g., a Dark Tetrad) are also discussed. The chapter closes discussing future directions for dark personality traits, including novel assessment methods, further validation, and narcissism's place in an expanded nomological network of dark traits. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.}

  abstract = {This essay is an interpretation of the phenomenon of the selfie. The author considers what the phenomenon of the selfie says about the constitution of the human subject. Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory of the subject is used as a fulcrum to investigate, in particular, his reflections on the gaze (le regard) and the role it plays in the process of constituting human subjectivity. The author takes one specific "mirror selfie" and consistently examines various aspects of the gaze in relation to it: the gaze as it constitutes and verifies the identity of the subject - this aspect is explained with the help of Lacan's "double-mirror device," which structurally is very similar to selfie; the ideological dimension of the gaze and "visual interpellation," which installs the subject into the big Other; the gaze as the objectcause of desire - this aspect explains why one is not satisfied with a single selfie and turns this practice into a constant cyclical pattern; the unbearable inevitability of the gaze and of the attempt to take control of it - the selfie is considered as an attempt to tame the gaze of the Other, to gentrify it; the monstrous Real dimension of the gaze - here one can find analysis of shaming and other cases of traumatic encounters with the gaze of the Other. This traumatic dimension demonstrates that taming of the gaze is something that is doomed to ultimately fail. The author concludes that new technologies, and in particular the new possibilities of self-representation they provide, do not distort the nature of man, but, on the contrary, only reveal it with greater clarity.}

Our replicated findings reveal that sex, age and extraversion are reliable predictors of several types of social media use (e.g., Facebook, Messaging Platforms, Online Forums), while other traits (e.g., agreeableness, Machiavellianism) showed unreliable associations. Our findings also reveal dimensions of multiplatform social media use that categorize the media ecologies of young adults and show significant associations with individual difference measures. \textcopyright{} 2020}

Crucially, although privacy concerns and awareness have increased, the use of these apps, and related privacy behaviors, remain largely unchanged. Given that such privacy behaviors are likely influenced by individuals' personality traits, it is imperative to better understand which personality traits make individuals more vulnerable to such unauthorized uses. We build on a recontextualized version of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to evaluate the influence of the Big Five personality traits on attitudes toward Facebook privacy settings, social norms, and information privacy concerns (IPCs)\textemdash all within the context of Facebook app use. To evaluate this study's model, we analyzed 576 survey responses by way of partial least squares path modeling. Results indicate that highly extraverted individuals are particularly vulnerable to privacy violations (e.g., unauthorized use of personal information) because of their negative attitudes toward Facebook privacy settings. Our post hoc analysis uncovered interesting combinations of personality traits that make individuals particularly vulnerable to the unauthorized use of app-based information. In particular, the combination of extraversion and conscientiousness had a negative effect on individuals' attitude toward privacy settings. We also found a significant negative relationship between IPCs and intention to use Facebook apps. Finally, we found a positive relationship between social norms and intentions. Taken together, these results infer that individuals are likely to be influenced by their peers in the use of Facebook apps but that their intentions to use these apps declines as privacy concerns increase. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s) Facebook apps; Personality traits; Information privacy concerns (IPCs); Vulnerability; Facebook privacy settings; Path modeling; Interaction analysis. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s)}

In this context, new social media are available for the rupture of traditional relations, where digital interaction protocols are established, as well as overflows of preestablished ethical codes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the construction of the concept of fanbullying as the pernicious relationship between fans and actors through social media. To this end, we developed a literature review, broadening the spectrum of citizen excesses in the digital age through bullying, cyber-bullying and hate speech, and an analysis of media cases from the series 13 Reasons Why, Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. The results discover the disproportionate use of these platforms by the fan community, where actors are exposed as public figures to constant mockery, humiliation and threats. Therefore, beyond the adjacent personal relationships and the purely school environment, we conclude that in digital environments new practices of fanbullying are being developed where the boundaries between reality and fiction are blurring, resulting in the need for an educational-juridical intervention.. \textcopyright{} 2020 Universidad de Sevilla.

We temporarily lowered participants' self-control capacity with an ego depletion paradigm (i.e., color Stroop task). Next, we measured participants' sensitivity to social cues with an emotional Stroop task containing neutral, negative, and taboo words. Sensitivity to social cues is represented by the increase in reaction time to negative and especially taboo words compared to neutral words. As expected, undepleted participants were slower to process the color of negative and taboo words. By contrast, depleted participants (i.e., those with lowered self-control capacity) did not react differently to taboo or negative words than they did to neutral words. The experiment illustrates that self-control failure may manifest itself in a failure to recognize social cues. The finding underlines the importance of self-control in understanding disinhibited online behavior: Many instances of disinhibited online behavior may occur not because people are unable to control themselves, but because they do not realize that a situation calls for self-control in the first place. \textcopyright{} 2018 Voggeser, Singh and G\"oritz.}

It was predicted that personality traits involving arrogance and exploitativeness (i.e., low Honesty-Humility) and impulsivity (i.e., low Conscientiousness) would be indirectly associated with social dominance, through bullying, in both samples. Consistent with evolutionary psychological perspectives, Honesty-Humility was directly and indirectly related to social dominance in both samples, whereas Conscientiousness was indirectly associated through bullying in Canadian and Chinese participants. Some relations differed across cultural contexts, in line with evolutionary and ecological perspectives suggesting that the expression of predispositions toward bullying and dominance depends on the costs and benefits afforded by the environmental (cultural) context. Specifically, eXtraversion was indirectly related to social dominance through bullying only in the Chinese sample, whereas Agreeableness was directly related to social dominance only for Canadian participants. We discuss the implications of these results for future research and intervention efforts along with the need to further verify the cross-cultural validity of adolescent behavior measures. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.}

This insecure environment of OSN needs attention to prevent the damage caused by these crimes to society. Cyberbullying is reported as one of the harmful crimes causing psychological damage to victims. Cyberbullying has dangerous effects on the victim, which may also lead the victim to suicidal attempt. Victims of cyberbullying are usually afraid or embarrassed to reveal about their harassment. It has become a necessity to detect and prevent cyberbullying. Many researchers are working in multiple directions to achieve best results for automated cyberbullying detection.

However, there is a lack of empirically tested theories and investigation of correlates that could help to understand young people's involvement in cyberhate. To fill this gap, the present study aims to test the Routine Activity Theory to explain cyberhate victimisation and the Problem Behaviour Theory to understand cyberhate perpetration. Participants were 5433 young people (Mage = 14.12, SDage = 1.38; 49.8\% boys from ten countries of the EU Kids Online IV survey). Self-report questionnaires were administered to assess cyberhate involvement, experiences of data misuse, frequency of contact with unknown people online, problematic aspects of sharenting, excessive Internet use, and sensation seeking. Results showed that being a victim of cyberhate was positively associated with target suitability (e.g., experiences of data misuse, and contact with unknown people), lack of capable guardianship (e.g., problematic facets of sharenting), and exposure to potential offenders (e.g., witnessing cyberhate, and excessive Internet use). Findings support the general usefulness of using Routine Activity Theory to explain cyberhate victimisation. Being a perpetrator of cyberhate was positively associated with several online problem behaviours (e.g., having contact with unknown people online, excessive Internet use, and sensation seeking), which supports the general assumption of the Problem Behaviour Theory. The findings of this research can be used to develop intervention and prevention programmes on a local, national, and international level. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors}

Multi-group path analysis showed that for those who were low in Machiavellianism condition, physical and verbal bullying was negatively linked to peer acceptance and academic performance while no significant association was found for the high-Machiavellianism group. Bullying was negatively, yet non-significantly, associated with rule-following behavior for both groups.

The present work examined the most common behaviors and criteria used to operationalize cyberstalking within the quantitative literature. The definitions employed by the studies were evaluated in respect of (a) whether they included a minimum requirement for the number of times the behaviors needed to be repeated in order to be considered ``cyberstalking''; (b) whether victim fear was required for the behaviors to be considered ``cyberstalking''; (c) the timeframe within which the cyberstalking behavior needed to have occurred; and (d) the behaviors identified as indicating cyberstalking. The results demonstrated considerable variation in the specificity of criteria used. Of the 33 studies examined, 45\% specifically defined a minimum number of behavioral repetitions required to classify the behaviors as ``cyberstalking,'' although there were some discrepancies in the number of behaviors specified across studies. Only 30\% of studies included victim fear as a criterion and 70\% of studies did not include specific timeframe requirements in which the behaviors needed to have occurred within. The number and description of behaviors included within scales used to measure ``cyberstalking'' varied widely. Some instruments utilized as many as 24 different items, whilst others identified cyberstalking through the use of two items. A series of recommendations are advanced aimed at providing criteria for defining and operationalizing cyberstalking that can be employed by future studies, with the ultimate aim of allowing greater comparability between results. From this a consistent knowledge base can be developed, and with it a deeper understanding of cyberstalking and how to counter it. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.}

While these SNSs encourage respectful or acceptable behavior and adherence to conduct standards, incidences of obscene language, personal attacks, cyberbullying, racial, gender or sexual bias, and hate speech are rampant. Prior research suggests that this type of unacceptable or deviant behavior can be attributed to Dark Triad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy).

This study aimed to examine how and in what way loneliness influenced PIU. Methods: A self-report measurement on loneliness, the Internet addiction test (IAT) and instruments on interpersonal problems were administered to 318 medical students (57\% females); mean age totaled 20.88 years (SD = 1.8). We performed a mediation analysis to evaluate direct effects of loneliness on IAT, as well as indirect effects mediated by interpersonal problems. In addition, motivation for internet use was added to the mediation model and tested whether it acted as the second mediator (serial mediation model) or a moderator (moderated mediation model). Results: After controlling for sex and age, socially inhibited problems exhibited full mediation whereas the remainder showed partial mediation effects, with the exception that intrusive and cold interpersonal problems indicated no mediating role. Negative motivation and motivation for being accepted had mediation effects for all types of interpersonal problems. Motivation for working was found to be a significant mediator and moderator of the most interpersonal problems. Intrusive and cold styles became a mediator only when some motivation variables were added to the model, implying that not only psychological problems should be included when analyzing PIU, but also other variables such motivation for internet use. The percent of variance explained, by IAT score, increased from 13\% in the mediation model to 33\% by the moderated mediation model, and 43\% using the serial mediation model. Conclusion: The study suggested the crucial role of loneliness and interpersonal problems on PIU, for which motivation for internet use explained how each interpersonal problem would be associated. This may provide some insight regarding the pathological characteristics of those using the internet as a coping strategy. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).}

A total of 1123 college students completed questionnaires regarding their experience with online trolling, mindfulness, social media fatigue, and moral disengagement. The results showed that individuals with high mindfulness were less likely to troll others online, which was mediated by their social media fatigue. Furthermore, moral disengagement moderated the indirect relationship between mindfulness and online trolling. Specifically, the relationship between mindfulness and social media fatigue became weaker for individuals with high moral disengagement. The relationship between social media fatigue and online trolling became strengthened for individuals with high moral disengagement. These findings elucidate the role of personal factors and the present internal state in online trolling and suggest that comprehensive intervention programs may be promising for reducing online trolling. \textcopyright{} 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.}

Post-secondary education has been an important pathway to guide students out of poverty by helping them lead successful lives. However, as in higher education, cyberbullying incidents have increased in educational situations, the bullied victims are more likely to report feelings of depression that cause an obstacle to their academic achievements in post-secondary education. The anonymous environments associated in cyberbullying can cause immorality of the cyberbullying perpetrators. To prevent cyberbullying on campus, this article provides cyberbullying rules and policies and suggests specialized treatment and interventions for cyber-bullies as a solution.

  abstract = {In this study, we want to conceptually and empirically distinguish those who deliberately seek to create division in an online forum by inauthentically voicing an anti-majority opinion\textemdash a specific type of ``online trolls,'' from the vocal minorities\textemdash those who speak out against the majority to express their unpopular viewpoint. 599 participants recruited from Amazon MTurk completed an online experiment. They were randomly assigned to post a comment after reading a series of either all positive or all negative reviews of a branded product. We coded participants' comments based on their preexisting attitude towards the product brand and grouped the participants into five behavioral types: 1) vocal and silent (normative) majorities (n = 235), 2) silent minorities (n = 75), 3) social conformers (n = 117), 4) vocal minorities (n = 95), and 5) ``online trolls'' (n = 46). Both vocal minorities and ``online trolls'' explicitly expressed opposition to the majority opinion, but the ``trolls'' spoke out against the majority opinion against their own beliefs. Based on past research, we identified Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism as the set of personality markers that might differentiate the trolls from the vocal minorities. Our results were mixed. As expected, the ``online trolls' scored the highest on psychopathy and sadism among all the behavioral types. However, the trolls were not distinguishable from the vocal minorities on the psychopathy trait. This study extends the existing literature on linking personality traits to technology-mediated social behavior. It also informs social research on online trolling and cyberactivism. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd}

In this paper, we develop a novel automated classification model that identifies the cyberbullying texts without fitting them into large dimensional space. On the other hand, a classifier.cannot provide a limited convergent solution due to its overfitting problem. Considering such limitations, we developed a text classification engine that initially pre-processes the tweets, eliminates noise and other background information, extracts the selected features and classifies without data overfitting. The study develops a novel Deep Decision Tree classifier that utilizes the hidden layers of Deep Neural Network (DNN) as its tree node to process the input elements. The validation confirms the accuracy of classification using the novel Deep classifier with its improved text classification accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2021}

  abstract = {In the modern era, the cyberbullying (CB) is an intentional and aggressive action of an individual or a group against a victim via electronic media. The consequence of CB is increasing alarmingly, affecting the victim either physically or psychologically. This allows the use of automated detection tools, but research on such automated tools is limited due to poor datasets or elimination of wide features during the CB detection. In this paper, an integrated model is proposed that combines both the feature extraction engine and classification engine from the input raw text datasets from a social media engine. The feature extraction engine extracts the psychological features, user comments, and the context into consideration for CB detection. The classification engine using artificial neural network (ANN) classifies the results, and it is provided with an evaluation system that either rewards or penalizes the classified output. The evaluation is carried out using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that improves the performance of classification. The simulation is carried out to validate the efficacy of the ANN-DRL model against various metrics that include accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure. The results of the simulation show that the ANN-DRL has higher classification results than conventional machine learning classifiers. \textcopyright{} 2021 N. Yuvaraj et al.}

Many researches in psychology and e-health have been conducted to detect the act of cyber-violence. In computational field, most of works have focused on multiple aspects of cyber-violence, but none of them, to our knowledge, have studied the perpetrator's harmful behaviour from an emotional dimension. Our goal in this work is to discover the relationship between the emotional state of social media users and their harmful behaviour while engaged in the act of cyber-violence. Our approach is based on Ensemble Machine Learning and engineered features related to Plutchik wheel of basic emotions extracted with semantic similarity and word embedding. The results show a significant association between the individual's emotional state and the harmful intent, which may be a good indicator for cyber-violence detection.

This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between neuroticism and cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization), taking into account depression as a potential mediator and gender as a moderator of the association. A sample of 3961 Chinese early adolescents (56.1\% boys; age: M = 10.85 years, SD = 0.75) completed multiple measurements of the relevant constructs on three occasions at six-month intervals. The results showed that neuroticism and depression were reciprocally related. Neuroticism directly predicted subsequent cyberbullying victimization, and depression predicted both subsequent cyberbullying perpetration and cyberbullying victimization. Neither cyberbullying perpetration nor victimization predicted subsequent neuroticism or depression. Depression mediated the relation from neuroticism to subsequent cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization). Finally, gender differences did not moderate any of the longitudinal relations among neuroticism, depression, and cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization). These findings add to the literature on neuroticism and cyberbullying in early adolescents by demonstrating the presence of longitudinal associations mediated by depression. Implications for interventions to reduce the risk of cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization) among early adolescents were discussed. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

A sample of 4327 Chinese elementary school students (55.4\% boys; age: M = 9.94 years, SD = 0.73) completed measurements of the relevant constructs on five occasions across two years, using half-year intervals. The findings revealed that neuroticism, cyberbullying perpetration, and cyberbullying victimization all decreased over time. Additionally, cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization) at baseline positively correlated with neuroticism at baseline. Furthermore, cyberbullying (perpetration and victimization) decreased in parallel with decreases in neuroticism.

This study examined whether dark personality traits would be associated with cyber aggression in adolescents, whether belief in virtuous humanity would mediate the relationship between dark personality traits and cyber aggression, and whether self-control would play a moderating role in the links. A total of 675 Chinese college students completed a series of anonymous questionnaires regarding dark personality traits, belief in virtuous humanity, self-control, and cyber aggression. Results showed the following: (1) dark personality was positively related to cyber aggression in adolescents; (2) belief in virtuous humanity mediated the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression; (3) self-control play a moderating role in the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression, and the relationship between belief in virtuous humanity and cyber aggression. This study could help demonstrate the risk and protective factors and psychological mechanism of cyber aggressive behavior in adolescents.

  abstract = {Understanding the influencing factors of cyberbullying is key to effectively curbing cyberbullying. Among the various factors, this study focused on the personal level of individual students and categorized the influencing factors of cyberbullying among college students into five sublevels, i.e., background, Internet use and social network habits, personality, emotion, and literacy related to digital citizenship. Then a questionnaire survey was applied to 947 Chinese college students. The results show that cyberbullying among Chinese college students are generally at a low level. There are many factors influence cyberbullying. Specifically, at the personal background level, gender has a significant impact on cyberbullying and being cyberbullied. In terms of personal Internet use and social network habits, students' average daily online time has no significant correlation with cyberbullying and being cyberbullied; however, the proportion of online non-learning time has a significantly positive correlation with cyberbullying, and the proportion of online learning/work time has a significant impact on being cyberbullied. At the personality level, the Big Five personality traits have varying degrees of correlation with and influence on cyberbullying and being cyberbullied. At the personal emotions level, students' life satisfaction has a significantly negative correlation with cyberbullying and being cyberbullied while it only has a significant impact on being cyberbullied; the personal stress and empathetic concern aspects of empathy have a significantly positive correlation with cyberbullying and being cyberbullied among female students. At the literacy related to digital citizenship level, students' understanding of and compliance with Internet etiquette have significantly negative impacts on cyberbullying; the ability to communicate and collaborate online and Internet addiction have significantly positive impacts on cyberbullying and being cyberbullied; the understanding of and compliance with relevant digital laws and regulations have significantly negative correlations with cyberbullying and being cyberbullied. Overall, college students' digital citizenship level has a significantly negative correlation with cyberbullying but no significant correlation with being cyberbullied. Finally, analysis and suggestions were provided according to these statistical results and the effects of these factors on cyberbullying and being cyberbullied among college students, so as to help solve this problem and provide a new perspective for research in this field. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Zhong, Zheng, Huang, Mo, Gong, Li and Huang.}

  abstract = {The objective is to predict and analyze the behaviors of users in the social network platform by using the personality theory and computational technologies, thereby acquiring the personality characteristics of social network users more effectively. First, social network data are analyzed, which finds that the type of text data marks the majority. By using data mining technology, the raw data of numerous social network users can be obtained. Based on the random walk model, the data information of the text status of social network users is analyzed, and a user personality prediction method integrating multi-label learning is proposed. In addition, the online social network platform Weibo is taken as the research object. The blog information of Weibo users is obtained through crawler technology. Then, the users are labeled in accordance with personality characteristics. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relation between the user personality characteristics and the user behavior characteristics of the Weibo users. The correlation between the network behaviors and personality characteristics of Weibo users is analyzed, and the scientificity of the prediction method is verified by the Big Five Model of Personality. By applying relevant technologies and algorithms of data mining and deep learning, the learning ability of neural networks on data characteristics can be improved. In terms of performance on analyzing text information of social network users, the user personality prediction method of integrated multi-label learning based on the random walk model has a large advantage. For the problem of personality prediction of social network users, through combining data mining technology and deep neural network technology in deep learning, the data processing results of social network user behaviors are more accurate. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.}
